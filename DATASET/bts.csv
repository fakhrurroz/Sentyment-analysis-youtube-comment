They are too sensitive to pain of others and their own.”  Girl: “You know your mom is very wise.”  Little boy: “Thank you. She is also an angel, but she already returned home.”"

"used this for getting me through a 2,000-word essay. I accidentally wrote 4,000 words."
"If you are ARMY, you can listen 7 voices in this video. :)"
Rm: If you don't study ill shave your eyebrows All the armys: *uses this playlist to study* Me: *uses the playlist to distract myself from class and draw on the ipad*
"I don't know how to express my feelings...but BTS and army...are both reasons of each other that ,today ...... The BTS 💜 is World wide boy band....and Army is worldwide fandom...........And last but not least... To the one who is reading this....  There is no escape from our own efforts....so be honest to yourself.. belive yourself...and love yourself 💜💖"
"those of you struggling, feeling lost, lonely, depressed, I promise you, there is someone who is able to take away ever burden, heavy thought, or heartache you experience, His love for you is everlasting, you may see yourself as a horrible person or even underserving of love, but I guarantee, nothing you could ever do could dwindle his love for you, there is nothing he wouldn't do to protect you, and keep you safe in his loving arms, he even died for you, knowing you may never love Him back. You aren't here by accident or chance, but you were made on purpose, for a purpose. God love you soooo much, you're his child, the reason he smiles, his prized possession, his masterpiece. You woke up for a reason today, so don't give up, turn to Him and feel a peace and joy you never thought possible, you're going to overcome whatever you're going through, you're not alone. Jesus loves you with an unfathomable love. So take time today to explore and freely accept the love of Jesus, I promise you, you have nothing to lose♥️ John 3:16, Psalm 23"
"Don't worry Namjoon , I'm studying , jus-just don't shave my eyebrows Edit: after 1 hour and 35 minutes I studied the first part of literature now I have to study Giovanni Pascoli's life and his poems, then Giuseppe Ungaretti and Umberto Saba"
"Life Goes On came on and I felt nostalgic. I miss them 🥺 until we meet in the purple ocean ARMY💜 I can’t wait till corona is over and we can reunite and see BTS 🥺 Meanwhile, let’s keep supporting the guys and celebrate the records they’re breaking on the daily. Let’s get it !! ✨"
"What ever you're chasing for, lies ahead. What ever you belive in, will be achieved. Those days and nigths that you are figthing for will never let you down. To the one who's reading this just hang in there, you'll be successful someday, just belive in yourself, because every industious one will be the lucky one. Hope your future is bright, Let's meet each other when that time comes. I'm rooting for you."
"Bts es lo único que tengo como mi consuelo ,ellos son las únicas personas que han utilizado sus palabras mas sinceras para hacerte sentir bien contigo mismo . Cosas que nunca van entender las personas que nunca lo han conocido"
But can you guys actually concentrate while listening to this playlist? I just end up singing to all the songs in my head (or out loud) and not getting anything done😭😭😂💔

"Honestly I'm pretty scared to quit stanning bts mostly because they made me smile during those dark times, they are literally my life.I just can't live without them. I will continue to support them for 5 more years (until they disband) Army for life ✊🏻💜"
Doesn't it happen to you that you want to study with this playlist but get distracted every three seconds because your head starts to sing the song? ;(
"💜💜💜💜💜💜nunca desista ami , o mundo pode ser muito cruel mas você é mais forte que tudo por conseguir chegar até aqui , você vai enfrentar todas as barreiras e obstáculos,  mesmo que o mundo tente te derrubar eu sei que você vai levantar de cabeça erguida , sei que você é capaz .💜💜💜💜           Never give up army , i know you can. I PURPLE YOU AMIIIIIIIII"
"First of all, I've heard a few piano versions of various BTS' songs but these were the best. Kudos! Second thing, have you seen your playlist? How can anyone study while listening to the Piano covers of any of those songs? Its more like a sobbing session than a study session!! I heard Spring day and thought, its okay next song will help me focus on studying but No, LOL. FML. Anyway, everyone trying to study, FIGHTING! Believe in yourself, you can do it!! YOU GOT THIS."
"I got 100% :( because of BTS, I love them so much they give me so much support when I hear them. I'm so happy that I knew them :("
Me literally me  matching the words that i spoke while studying to the euphoria piano 😂😂
"""Decide for yourself what it means to be happy.” -BTS    i think...     :)"
"to everyone studying or doing homework, leave the comments and stay focus. use your blanket and cover it over your body to get comfy and less stress. take a sip of water and put all your distractions away. close your room door so you won’t get distracted by the noise outside. hope you get an A on your test your studying for or an A for your homework. ❤️   to everyone that is trying to sleep by playing this song, leave the comments, close your eyes, think about happy moments and make sure you don’t get cold. ( this is really what I do to sleep ) so no more using your phone.❤️  to everyone drawing, good job keep the good work up! your art is beautiful. even if you think it’s ugly, it is still considered art. no matter what, your artwork will be a masterpiece and it is beautiful. if you don’t think it meets your expectations, there is no need to think negatively, think positively and try again. work on the areas you think has to improve but whatever your artwork looks like, it’s still beautiful and it will always be a masterpiece ❤️   to everyone is exercising, meditating or even doing yoga, continue doing, don’t get distracted. even if your body doesn’t change, you still look pretty/handsome. if anyone calls you ugly or names, don’t trust them, their just jealous of your good looks and everyone in this world is beautiful and they will always be. ❤️      everyone reading this have a good day and remember to concentrate on what your doing, don’t let what others says or thinks stop you from doing what you love. im sure if you keep practicing or keep trying your best, I’m sure one day whatever your doing will improve and reach your expectations. ❤️"
I can here their voices ( ◜‿◝ )♡
this reminds me of the old days when they were struggling but they didn't gave up and see where they are now
Namjoon when see the comment be like: HEY ARMY WHY YOU DID NOT STUDY I AM GONNA SHAVE YOUR EYEBROWS😡🤣
"Hey you👋. Yes, you😊. You're probably scrolling through the comments, like I am, reading all these motivational comments. If you are reading this at night, you should get some sleep, and don't stress about everything going on in the world, or what you are going through. Don't dwell on things from the past, don't stress on your future. Just live your life, because you only get one. Do whatever makes you happy, not what other people want from you. 🤦‍♂️  For me, I'm gonna wake up tomorrow morning, maybe get some exercise and do some videos for my YouTube channel, while I wait for school to start. I think it's pretty boring because of coronavirus, but I know it'll end eventually, and things will start to brighten up. Stay safe, and take a chill pill❤  - Relaxing Music for Ambient ❤"
Y pensar que estas canciones me estan tranquilizando antes de ver que clase se resultado obtendré en el hospital
My mom doesn’t let listening to music during studying but once I did and she was amazed and happy with her work too and at last realized too   I am really happy now and my mom too
"Why is everyone in the comments so sweet, I'm gonna cry 😭❤ y'all really motivate me to keep going, thank you so much Have a nice day and stay healthy 🦋"

I am literally holding in my tears as Life Goes On plays
"Friend: why are you studying all the time. Me: 5 hours of BTS and good grades, what more do you need?"

As soon as Spring Day started playing.. I realized I know the lyrics without listening to them.. 💜 P.S. I'm new ARMY nd I love this song sooooooooo much 🥺
"I'm crying because i imagine when they totally have their own families and forget us!     Because of BTS I stop committing Suicide! I don't even know how i become a ARMY,Beacause of them I'm smiling even tho I'm so stressed! I LOVR YOU BTS! YOU PROVE TO ALL ARMY THAT WE'RE LITERALLY STRONG!♡♡☺😭"
Me now : studying maths and crying 💜     Love u BTS Love u MIN YOONGI
Me: *playing it for studying* ( heard Spring Day) *Ends up crying*
"At first I was not going to comment, but then during I need you I just couldn't stop myself.  I am going through quite a rough time in my life rn, I realised many things, one of the most important person ghosted me. I tried to be strong and not cry because everyone say that I cry very easily, m quiet embarrassed from this fact so I tried not to cry, I watched bts funny vedio so that I can lift up my mood,  I was refraining myself from listening their songs because I knew it that the moment I listen it, I'll break down, then this was vedio came in my recommendation.  Then I just couldn't stop myself from listening and now I can't stop crying 😅. I discovered about bts back in 2016, but I didn't liked them,  then in 2017 many things changed and I listened to them and it was like a switch going off somewhere inside my heart  Before bts I didn't even knew that I needed someone like them in my life, I never knew that a person can feel all these emotions , Bts is always there like a blanket  Whenever I think that I don't have anyone, my heart and my mind tell me, no, u have bts don't worry  Ik m babbling at this point but I just can't help it.  Because at this point I don't even bother explaining to people that what bts means to me coz ik they won't get it until they themself experience it  I'm a very talkative person but whenever it comes to bts m at a loss of words because every word feels like , no this can't describe them, no this can't describe my feeling so I am not able to express what they are to me  Borahae bts 💜 Borahae armys💜💜💜💜"
"damn, bts songs was one of the reason why i'm still fighting."

"THis comment section made me cry. I wanted to do all my pent up homework and I scrolled through the comment section and now I'm crying. Idk why. Like we all never seen each other. Don't know  each other's names. Nothing. But ARMYS always make everyone feel like we are close to each other. I'm an ARMY for five years. And I HV never felt scared to go and talk to another ARMY. We always welcome new members like we are some some family. This helps the ones who is trying to get out from toxic family, toxic friends, toxic relationship all the toxic things. Yes some of the Stans call themselves ARMYS but they send hate to the genuine ARMYS. But we should care about the real feelings we are sharing everywhere we go. I love you ARMYs. Thank you for being my virtual friend!!! I love you again...."
"Words can't explain, but I love them so much."

"not me tryna study while listening to piano bts music instead of bts music with lyrics so that i cant sing along, but still ending up singing along... i-😶😑💀"
"Even though I've been an army for a long time, I never got a chance to ever go to a concert and I probably will never be able to go to one ever. But still, when ever I hear one of their songs I swear I can hear each and everyone of their voices. Just listening to their music and knowing that people from across the world are still here because of them makes me wanna smile and cry all st once. So for me it doesn't matter whether I went to their concerts or did anything to meet or to see them, what matters to me is that I know that they care for people they've never met before and that they are heroes through and through.  Thank you BTS for all thw wonderful moments💜  Sincerely, one of the millions of ARMY💜💜💗💗🌎 🌎"
"I know you guys are also scrolling through the comments and reading them.  So, whoever is reading this one I'm wishing and praying for your life, always remember I love you alot even though you might not know who I am even, we might be far apart by distance but as far as you are an Army we share the same soul and we will always be a family. I just want to wish you all the best for your life and stay blessed always, borahae! 🥺💜"

I USE THIS FOR SLEEP AND REMIND ME OF SONGS OUR GROUP DID
"Honestly this made me cry a lot more than i expected... I was an army from 2015-2019. I went to 3 concerts with vip tickets and just spent everday with them by watching videos of them and just listened to their music. I stopped listening to bts because i thought i should focus more on my future life, because bts was my everything. I got a boyfriend, finished school, got a job and thought i would be happy like that. I rarely checked up on their twitter to see how they are doing but never really listened to the new songs the past few years. And all i can say is: i really miss the old times. I was just so happy, to wake  up with bts and know that there is something that makes me so happy when i see them. I feel like thez are the only good ppl in this world. I feel so sad right now because i stopped stanning them even though they were the only reason i could smile. So i just want to say THANK YOU for putting this on youtube because it reminds me of better days. I am convinced that all members of bts will have a special place in my heart, forever 💜"
I use this music while studying and taking notes. Sounds so nice! I am an army since December 2020 💜💜
"One day if I'm pregnant, I will play this music to my baby.. I swear, this is so beautiful. ♥"
the way you choose spring day for the first song.
i have an exam today will i be able to do my best

This is the most beautiful thing ever to exist on YouTube.
"De verdad no dediquen esta joyita a cualquier persona , hasta estar segurx ."
"Otra canción a la lista de ""Canciones que no se dedican"""
;; *_Solo vine para decirles que esta joya no se le dedica a cualquier persona_*
"Insisto en que el coro (o bueno, la parte principal) lo canta Yoongi, pero voy a quedar así 🤡"
"Mi pregunta aquí es, ¿Porque esté Vídeo está en YT y no en el Museo, por la obra de arte que es💜."
no se si soy la única que cree que la canción va dedicada a army??? (esta canción debería tener un mv)
*Solo vengo a decir que todo lo que haces es arte*
"¡Feliz año! (´∀｀)♡ Cuéntenme, ¿Cuáles fueron sus 10 canciones favoritas del 2020?"
Like si creias que Yoongi cantaba el estribillo xd
"la portada con el taekook, amo aquí."
"Amo la carita de Yoongiiii, muero de amor **c muere** 0:18"
"_Oh Shit, Ni a Mis Clases Llego Tan Temprano. 😔🤟_"
Todos:               Esta canción no se le dedica a cualquiera. Yo:        Se la dedicare a mi perro :V
"Mi prometido me la dedico antes de pedirme matrimonio, la puso de broma y me dijo que me la dedicaba❤     creo que elegí al indicado❤"
"Una de mis canciones favoritas del álbum, me hace feliz 😊"
No se imaginan cuánto amo está canción :') ❤
Los que creíamos que eran Yoongi quedamos así 🤡 total siempre quedo así 🤣
Se la dedico a mi mamá.
"Voy a decirlo una vez más y lo repetiría las veces que fueran  necesarias, la estética es H E R M O S A ♡"
"Hola, solo vine a hacer una pregunta ¿Qué pasó con la traducción de Magic Shop? :( Realmente ame como te quedó ese vídeo ahora ya no lo encuentro :(."
Mi fav del álbum ozy 💙🥺😎
"sólo vengo a decir que Yoongi compuso esto en 30 minutos, gracias por su atención"
Yo pensando que Yoongi cantaba los coros: 🤡 xD
Se la dedico a Min Yoongi ❤️✨
"Estaba esperando esta traducción, soy consciente que pude haber leído otra traducción. Pero decidí ser paciente y esperar el arte"
"Dediquen la canción,somos seres humanos  Ñeeee no se crean  Jajajajjajajaa PA ti min yoongi."
"Oigan, amigxs ¿Es normal que esté llorando con este rolón? :'u TwT"
Lo estaba esperando (人 •͈ᴗ•͈)💜
"Deja ir tus preocupaciones por un tiempo, las preocupaciones son inútiles ahora , olvídalas ahora , divertamonos juntos!! BTS- Telepathy esa frase me hiso reflexionar , que no tengo que preocuparme , tengo que olvidarla!!!  hare eso voy a divertirme como dice BTS!! Gracias bangtan los amo con todo mi corazon 💜💜💜"
Como no tengo a quien dedicar esta joyita te la dedico a ti preciosx que estas leyendo esto ...cuidate y ten un grandioso dia que yo y BTS aunque no te conozcamos sabemos lo hermosx que eres 💜💜💜  I purple you
"icónico diosYoongi escribió esta canción en 30 minutos, mientras que escuchaba el instrumental"
"Está hermoso , llegué tarde otra vez ,siempre me pasa ☹️ A las personas que pusieron dislike , todo bien en su casa?  Esto es ARTE 💜"
Como no tengo que a quien dedicarlo de se los dedicare a ustedes ❤🤗
Me la dedicaron :'''D
Esta canción siempre me anima. Me hace feliz pensar que es mutuo lo que sienten ellos por ARMY y lo que siente ARMY por Bangtan 💜
"Amo a JK, como se Ve 1:25"
"Vengo del futuro, y yoongi no era quien canta el coro, jajahsjajaja :( Como siempre quedando:"
hace rato estaba chillando con ABYSS y ahora estoy bien feliz con TELEPATHY
Y pensar q nos la dedicaron a todos los q estamos aquí 💜
"Yo no dude en dedicárselo a mi mejor amiga, sinceramente siento que hice bien, ella merece una joyita como esta. Realmente lo vale <3"
"2:07 el ""bebé"" de fondo de Namjoon LPM"
Duda existencial  el que canta el voto es yoongie?😳
WOW es increíble que Suga hayga escrito está canción en menos de media hora 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖😸😸💜💜
"Quede:🤡 Al enterarme que el que inicia la canción no se suga,es jungkook🤡🤸‍♂️🖐. Aún así es arte😾🖐❤"
Es arte de yoongi mi rey 🤗💜
Este es el tipo de canción que no se le dedica a cualquiera ..Anoten eso 📝
"Por fin, está va esperando tus trabucciones"
Ameeeee ❤ La edición del video es súper linda!!~
"Hasta que no vea la presentación en vivo, creeré que el coro [estribillo] lo canta Yoongi.<3"
porque nadie habla de lo hermoso que hace las traducciones y edicciones 😭
"Llegué 👁️👄👁️👍, para talKearte que no le dediques está pinShe joya de 27272 kilates de mis Chinitos bts 😭❤️ a cualquier persona, listo, no me lo agradezcas 7u7 👋❤️."
"Woa! Se ve lindo, vamos a ver qué tal, de seguro es arte como siempre 💙💙"
Solo puedes darte cuenta de lo perdida que estás cuando dedicas una canción de tu boyband favorita 😫💖
"Wuooo me encanto la canción y mas la tradición.. Me fascinó!!! Gracias x hacerlo!!

Todos diciendo que la canción no se dedica pero nadie dice Ay que bonito te quedó el vídeo de fondo 😔❤️✨
"Le dedique esta cancion a una persona y despues le termine dedicando ""Fake Love""🤧💔"
desde que la escuché por primera vez se unió a la lista de canciones que solo se le dedican a bts💌
ME ACABAN DE DEDICAR ESTA CANCION AAA SOY FELIZ 😭😭😭😭✋✋
"_Sabes que es la persona indicada cuando desde el principio piensas en ella, mi Soulmate a distancia...esto es para ti! Desde el fondo de mi corazoncito, está canción es nuestro himno, agredezco que estés en mi vida_"
Está hermosa joyita es de Bangtan para ARMY y de ARMY para Bangtan 💖 así que no se dedica a nadie más ✨

I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL WITH THIS COVER  PLAYING ON MY CARRRR!! THIS IS SO CHILL AND RELAXINGGG!!!!
"Wow 😯 I can’t believe she is in college, she looks so young!"
Can we appreciate the part that she is making videos when she gotta do lots of work from college ❤️
"I literally thought she was 9 or 10 years old, but while I was scrolling through the comments and I saw this certain comment, where she replied and said she's a freshman in college........I literally have to process it for about 5 mins"
I'm korean! You speak korean very well! I cheer up for you ~ ♡
Your pronounciation improved so much!
E: emily's cover song is like M: miracle and I: intersting! L:lovely her cover song is Y:you guy's favorite cover song❤️🌹

"Not me crying because of your soothing voice. Also, happy new year sweetie ! Wish you success in college and on your channel 🧡"
Bagus bngt cc! Glad you did a cover of my favourite boys too :)
"Hello! I am ARMY living in Korea!  I was surprised that you sang K-pop songs, BTS songs, and Korean lyrics fluently and sang so well!  I thought Korean was a bit hard for foreigners to sing, and I thought it would be hard for them to pronounce, but seeing you sing so well like Koreans, as a global person, as an ARMY, as a Korean, I sincerely thank you for calling me beautiful Korean!  English is so pretty and beautiful language!  I felt that as a person who is learning English even though I am not good at it, I should be more proud of my Korean! I'm so happy to be an ARMY! I enjoyed the video! If you've read my writing, this writing would be terrible, but please understand and reply to me! Corona 19, you're gonna have a hard time. Cheer up.  Please let me hear your beautiful voice often!! I love you!"
The best in providing cover .

"нежно и успокаивающе, спасибо. Вы прекрасны, удачи и хорошего настроения вам"
"Hey loves, I have uploaded another video from home party 2017. Please check it out. 💜"
Jimin and v  have same sense
Vmin are true soulmates
Jimin : jhope calls my name before going to bed😂😂😂😂
Jin and Suga are eternal roommates and soulmates. They are the most Cutest duo in bangtan. Suga generally will not express his love for Jin on camera's but his love for his one and only hyung is incredible. Yoonjin I purple you 💜
I think V knows everything about jk
No BTS without Jin. The joy of that group. He is both friends and siblings with other members. Dear Jin always cheers them up. He has a very good relationship with all members. Good thing you have Jin
"Who said there aren't soulmates, just look at JM and V💜💜💜"
RM is sooo cute maahn
Taeyhung knows jungkook's wall color 💜💜 omoo
My taekook heart🤣🥰💜
"J-Hope is like the little brother trying to catch the attention of his beloved older brother, Jimin,  who is not paying attention.  Jimin, Jimin, Jimin, Jimin, Jimin, Jimin!"
Vmin and taekook moments ugh💜💜💜💜💜🙆
What's wrong with Jin....at 3:10😂😂😂😂😂😂
Vmin 💜💜
bruh why SIN FOR JIN AND SUGA it can be YOONJIN but. SIN lol
V so cuteeeeeee 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
0:00- Sin 7:10- R&V 11:36- 3Js
"7:45 ""I hear the sound of your eyes rolling""...?!?!😂💜"
"SO HERE'S THE THING, OUR 8TH BTS ANNIVERSARY GOAL IS TO MAKE '""NO MORE DREAM'"" HIT IB.  I KNOW IT SOUNDS DIFFICULT BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT. BTS ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THEIR DEBT WAS NOT A BOP AND DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK BACK AT IT.  IF WE ARE ARMYS, HIT IT TO 1B, THEY WILL REALISE THAT THEY WERE KINGS BEFORE AND  NOW TOO.."
Why does Taehyung look so stressed like he's taking an exam?
Suga looks too handsome nd cute
"Jin & Suga were roommates. Jimin & Hobi were/are roommates too. RM, V & JK had their own rooms. They just made up r&v & 3js roommate groupings for the show. Just my guess, based on how their rooms looked like and the fact that jimin & hobi didn't know about jk's wall color, while Tae didn't know about Namjoon's Ryans."
Suga is very talkative 💜😂
Vmin is so cute ❤😘 JIHOPE ❤
That Suga + jin = sin            😭
Jimin & jk so cuteee 😍❤️❤️❤️😘
"This is gold.  I've been an Army since Dec '18, and have never seen this!  Thanks so much for posting!"
When did V and RM become roommates?? I thought RM and jungkook were....
"5:46 Not Suga saying he's confused with units because of traveling overseas. Mr. Min Yoongi, units of time are the same all over the world 😆"
"My 7 huggable babies, really cute!"
Such cuties I want to see taekook
How rm and v room are connected 🤔🤔
Thank you for the English captions!!!!!
Yoonjin😢😢😢😢 I love them
"Okay this might seem irrelevant but at 10:57 , V said that RM's favorite number is 4. I mean, he is the 4th member of Bts (in an order of oldest to youngest) but who is the 4th member to JOIN Bts? That's right. Jin.  *#NamJin*  (Edit: please don't take this seriously, my fellow Armys.)"
Taekook And Vmin 💜
wait was the song that jin practiced on the guitar?
Vimin😇🥰
Thanks for uploading I'm a new army
Vmin
0:28 Hobi 😂 💀
Thanks for uploading this vid..💜 I found only few moments from this video before and never saw the full interview😭😭
The pairing/grouping here is the same with that variety show with Jaeseok and the other guy. I didn't know it was based on who are roommates. They know chemistry so well.
💜💜💜
Set j💜💜💜💜💜
Fun fact: jit means triump in hindi. 2:12
BTS iam biggest army of  u
Telepathy ☺️
Vkook and Vmin😍😍😍
Minkook
Minkook
Jit...sounds like'jeet' Any Indians here?!🤭😜
Vmin😂
Taekook🐯🐰 Jikook🐥🐰 Vmin🐯🐥
And they were roomates
What bts show is that ?
If me and my brother play that game we really won this game
Not the telepathy hint
It is a love story?? Please say 🥺
Y/N having her period cramps  Bts:worried  Meanwhile me having period cramps My brothers:laughs at me suffering and makes fun of me
"'""Jimin: I do know how girls get through this every month.""  Girls are so frickin strong"
now i want a female member in BTS imagine bts and army princess she will be
the one dislike is from yeontan because he is jealous tae is spending time with Y/N hahaha
I really love this one.... No shipping... No romance.... Just care and fun... 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺💅
Me watching this on my periods be like: wow YouTube is god. Edit: thanks for the likes 💜  It means a lot thank you once again
"Jimin: I don’t know how girls get through this (period) every month.  Me: We have super powers, dear. 😌💅🏻"
Oh yes Jin scolding Y/N is the best thing ever
Why did I feel like I actually heard jins lecture💀💀💀💀💀💀?-
I want brothers or a husband like them😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 who understands how I feel😭😭😭😭
no one: not a single soul:                  jin: imma whoop yo ass
"9:17 Jin's next rap called ""Pain killer""😂😂"
I love how supportive and caring and understanding they are in this ff
"Well..can you do ""when you faint infront of them duirng an argument"""
"Reading this, I felt like I had 7 husbands😳"
I don't feel pain in my periods im the most lucky person in the world
We all know where the 7 dislikes came from 😬
Me: *watches one ff of this channel*   Me: *clicks the subscription button*  Me also: *mentally crying cause i donr have peopel like them*
"Just think about those female idols. I can't walk, but they dance. This FF is the best one 🥺💜 Unnie, Great Job!~"
Was anyone else just singing along and vibe with the background music?💜
7 dis likes  ..............   oppas really hate yn 's cramps
My grandparents call me cupcake as it is my all time favourite...so this reminds me of them...
"IF i was y/n and Tae will rub my stomach, I'd die."
Feels like I have 7 boyfriends
I NEED BROTHERS LIKE THEM PFOJDKXNX.
I lobe how Jin is shouting at me for not eating the damn pain killers 💜 luv you unnie 💜
Ya'll literally I have 4 brothers who live with me and 2 brothers who come at the weekends. Whenever I have cramps the 4 older bros just help me bear it but the 2 just make fun of it!
OMG this was so freaking Adorable I think I will need them during my periods
I can't believe I'm watching this on ny period and my stupid cramps just went away!! Thanks a lot!!
I love how Jin said no cursing and yet said while     Yelling a me
Omg this is the exact thing that I imagined wow And one more coincidence before watching this FF I was watching how to train your dragon
I want more of this kind of Fiction
"Unnnie..Can u plz make a ff where y/n is poor and she wants money for his grandpa surgery...so she decides to sell her one kidney..But where she went to donate it. She met a rich handsome guy who was the friend of doctor and talking with him.the doctor aka his friend asked u the reason as a prt of their duty..So u told everything...But That handsome guy who is the friend   fell in love with u cuz of ur kindness ..And when u gone from hospital..that guy delt with the doctor to give her money without taking her kidney...And not to tell her that .that rich guy helped her..and everything hapened as per planned..But then one day you found that someone helped u and that was that handsome guy with the doctor ..U went to the doctor and asked his number .then u met that person and u asked him to pay the debt..so he told not to pay her.but she insisted ..So he asked her if she knows english..As she seems well educated ...So she told that she is very good at english..So she became his teacher .sometimes she comes to his home for teaching him and sometimes he went to her small house...She did not know that he loved her..one day she gave him homework to write an essay in english on My Fav.Teacher...And there he described u in that essay ..And at the end he wrote ""and I Love my teacher and I am obsessed with her ""....from there she started avoiding him.bcz she thought it would be impossible to marry him cuz of different status..and also she has already returned his debt..So she left him..And .....then ....story goes on.......bla bla.b..but happy ending...."
Thanks a lot author you posted it on right time . It's the best period ff I have ever read.  You nice keep going 💜
The strong feeling of Killing this Y/N   is no joke 🙂😑
uhm- you shoul-dnt be dancing while on periods-
"Just so you know, in Korean culture only the males call their superior hyung, the females can only call a male “oppa”, never hyung  Edit: I did some more research and I found out that females sometimes do call males hyung but it’s usually a joke between close friends and some people said they never really hear that happening. I guess it maybe a sort of tomboy thing...?"
Jk:- u got ur blood day?      me:- that caught me!! lmao!!
Perfect timing to watch it .
"Jimin: *I don't know how girls get through this every month* Me, someone who doesn't get cramps that much: *Yeah, idk either*"
Im here!!
Jimin: Do I know how girls get through this every month Me: You will never knew😧
The funny thing is I am on my period right now and watching this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
jin rapping at me for not eating a god damn pill 😍  NAONAOJAPQNQPAPLASIYXTXNAO
"So here's the thing, our 8th anniversary goal is to make ""NO MORE DREAM"" hit 1B. I know it sounds difficult but we have to do it. BTS always thought that there debut song was not bop and didn't want to look back at it. If we arearmys, hit it to 1B, they will realize they were kings before and now too. Let's make their debut MV 1B. Let's do it armies. I know we can. Shere this as much as you can in every platform in various languages."
No one: Literally no one:        Yoongi: Worried sooo much about his pain killers ( after all money is the most precious thing) 😂😂😂
Jin's lecture on not eating a godamn pill was the best thing ever
I just finished my period or not today but this is really fun how Jin is mad because y/n didn't take the pain killer 😂
Me jamming to background music-
Happy New year 🥳💜 nice ff💜
"If I’m really the 8th member, I would just stuff my boyfriend 😂 who needs a cold boyfriend when you have 7 caring boys besides you"
Omg Jin start rapping again 😂😂😂
best award of mother goes to jin......
You know I thought you were the 8th member  not there girlfriend💀
Omg Jin scolding you because you didn’t take a pain killer 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love this channel just found it
"Only thing I'm thinking about is ""I'm watching my tone I ain't talking back no why because imma get throw"
am i the only one who thought that if i said *rawr* they all would huddle behind jin while jin has his pink slipper 💀🤚 no? ok
Tell me its not just me who's like Namjoon and his powers of destruction like I bend spoons 😂😂😂😅😅😅
Lmao I love Jin's Aduttuide in this it's the best
Yo. I love this because I always imagine being 8th member of BTS and they treat me as younger sister and the coincidence is that I'm actually younger than Jungkook Oppa... It's around 13 years of age gap
I don't know if its a coincidence.... today's my first day and it felt like they were with me😭😭😭😭
"Hello, this is a late new year gift for you guys and hope you have a pleasant year. Stay safe ❤️"
"That nickname ""cupcake"" stole my heart 😭💜💜"
"Video idea! Can you make a when you guys have a interview, and the interviewers start harassing you and BTS stood up for you. You as the 8th member! I LOVE UR VIDEOS UNNIE!!! 💜💜💜"
"""But this is dance practice room"" 😂😂"
Yeayy!!!! Her name is same as mine!!! And I never thought that my dream is here!!! I always imagine that I'm the 8th members and I've been covering some songs just for fun but I didn't put in Youtube or else 😊😊. Thanks a/n I love this so much 😁😁
The “ at least she doesn’t break stuff” got me hahah
Pleasee- 😭🤚🏼 Jin rappin again-
Jins character is Soo good ..I want this Jin in the life too
I'm crying 😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😔😔😔    Why     Idk  I started crying 😢😢😢 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"""you have the blood day again"" i'm chokingfq+2+hwjue 💀💀💀💀💀"
Me watching this while I'm on my period and crying bcz i don't have no one to take care of me
The way Jin gets mad 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤧 this is soo goood y/n is so lucky i want to be a kpop star too and watching this on my period😪 And jin whooping asses i love it 😭
jk hugging her becoz she had a stain was cuteeeee
Hello unnie can you please make y/n as 8th member when she gets lost and the members get worried?? Please this one. Thank you I Purple you 💜
I love how jin became a mom yeah I love it ppease make more!
I was literally crying and wishing if I also could be a member of bts. But it will never happened. But I still dream and feel a little good reading your storyline. Thanks a lot. Please make more video. So again I not get upset. Love you purple you💜💜💜
Whenever jin scold y/n he says young lady and whenever he scolds someone he always says the word whoop
im happy that I finally found one where they all have a sibling bond instead of a love story
"No food for u, but wait You’ll get hungry 😂😂💜 awesome ff 💜"
I'm having my period soon and I thought I would understand what will happen now I'm like I can't wait to die 😂😂😂
It would be soo lucky if every girl gets treated like her ❤️
My hearteu went uwu when jungkook came and backhugged while dance practise and i love the way they take care of their 8th member like theie own sister
Please continue this....bcz it's amazing.....plz unnie
"The word cupcake reminds me of cupcake armys wtf gosh.... Btw im a girl too but I won't feel a huge pain in my lower stomach when im on my period....  It won't hurt me that much when i have cramps...I won't crave for chocolates, snacks, will do the houseworks as usual, also I won't get angry for no reason..I wonder how the girls who actually going through these things manage themselves when they are on their period 0_0"
"I am in a full awe right now, i really really love this! So sweet~"
I got my first period today......... THIS SHIT HURTS  Btw I loved this ff💜💜
"I really love your ff and it nice to see that they care .... Now i am on my periods and it really hurt soooo bad but i don't have someone to take care of me..... Naamjoon, j-hope and taehyung sisters are really lucky to have them 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺"
Why they are so caring I'm crying
"Weird how i want to have a painfull period camps now ..🥴 BUT with them huh , THEM 😍"
Can you make more because I really love this series. Also can you make an Jungkook ff when you steal his banana milk
i always love to watch your video because the members are taking her as their little sister and not their girlfriend!
"Jin oppa is so, Mad at y/n 😂😂"
Can you make a part 2 please I am addicted unnie I want more
😂 I am on my periods right now having those dead killing cramps. But I am watching this instead of taking rest.🙄 While my mom is shouting at me for being in my phone without studying for my exam environmental 😂
This made me so soft 🥺🥺 i swear I felt that love and concern they gave y/n. If I had them in real life taking care of me like that I don't know what I'd do without them.
Please make more Y/N as the 8th member
"Honestly,  I swear  I really loved this ff❤❤❤❤❤ It was just the way I wanted one to be , the one I had imagined"

Will u update again
This is realy reaction???
"🇺🇸Hi! I actually want to please you with a good fmv, but I have absolutely no time. Throughout December I was overwhelmed with tests and exams, but nevertheless I tried to edit at least something. I know my last videos from the last month weren't that interesting.  I'm sorry for that. I did them in haste and am not very happy with the result. I have a lot of ideas for new fmvs that I really want to implement.   BUT exams haunt me. They are not over yet. I decided that it would be better to wait a bit for the end of my tests and make really good content than rush and still be unhappy with the result. I am very sorry for that. I hope you will be patient and wait for my new works❤️ 🇷🇺 Здравствуйте! Я на самом деле хочу порадовать вас хорошим fmv, но у меня совершенно нет времени. Весь декабрь я была перегружена зачетами и экзаменами, но тем не менее пыталась редактировать хоть что-нибудь. Я знаю, что мои последние видео за прошлый месяц были не такими интересными. Мне жаль за это. Я делала их на скорую руку и не очень довольна результатом. У меня есть много идей для новых fmv, которые я так хочу реализовать. НО экзамены не дают мне покоя. Они ещё не закончились. Я решила, что лучше будет немного подождать окончания моих зачётов и сделать действительно хороший контент, чем делать всё в спешке и все равно быть недовольным результатом. Я очень сожалею об этом.  Надеюсь, вы проявите терпение и дождетесь моих новых работ❤️"

Jungkook dan aku seharusnya
Yoongi is the weakest when it comes to Taehyung 🥺💜
Yoongi cant say no tete cause he loves tete
They’re all whipped for tae but who can blame them aren’t we all😭
"Jhope once said "" Thanks to  Taehyung,  BTS We are never bored and always hilarious. That's different from other boy bands"" It's true💜💜💜"
Jk can't say not to Tae Tae is so cute 💜
Every body say noooooo until Taehyung appears
yoongi's soft spot for tae is the most adorable..
Anybody would think he's the maknae😂💜
3:53 Now it should be what Taehyung want Taehyung gets...
Not only BTS we also can't say no to Taetae not even think of saying no to Taetae💜💜💜💜
tae truly is their baby :(
Lil meow meow can't say no to his tiny baby bear
They're so cute 🧡🧡 Imagine have friends that actually care about you and support your crazy ideas? My lonely ass couldn't never ;-;
I could watch these guys goof off all day long. They’re just one big wacky happy quirky family and it makes me feel better to watch them.
They all have soft spot love for Taehyung
Yoongi and Tae have the sweetest bond.
Not only BTS but we can never tell him no. Because we love him from our heart. And we like everything about him💞💞
"Taetae is so irresistible, plus he’s so loveable💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💚💚💚💚💚💚😍😍😍😍😍😍"

"Naughty: Jimin, RM Middle: Jungkook, Jhope Innocent:Jin, Tae Don't know, dont care : Yoongi"
"When Namjoon exposed Jin's chest he looked at the camera and nodded , guys I think he knows we thanked him ."
Me: *silent*  Namjoon: *does THAT whistle*  Me: *dead*
V : Is there something on my bum? RM:  The only thing on your bum is hotness. 😂😂😂
Naughty jimin and pure soul jin
The lady in the back. When jk said “international playboy” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
"If anyone has forgotten , I would like to remind them : Jungkook is still international playboy."
"I honestly feel like Jimin is the most dirty minded person in the group, even more than Namjoon. And that the innocent seeming ones definitely aren't"
Jin is that innocent friend who never understand double meaning 😂😂😂😂
Imagine ARMYs grinning at BTS being dirty when in reality hard stan ARMYs are equally or even more dirty.😏🌚
"Yoongi is the least perverted, well at least he doesn’t show it V:"
5:23  Jin be like: whyy whyy look down ⬇️🤣
"The perverts are hobi, namjoon and jimin 😂😂😂. Sometimes they include v and Suga."
Jimin and RM has the dirtiest mind 😂🤣💜
Suga : you are true man... So the underwear has a hole in the middle Jungkook:...... ARMY s : ^~^
RM and JIMIN ARE THE PERVERTED ONES OUT OF ALL. PERIOD!😂
I doubt if... BTS learned that from ARMY'S OR We ARMYS learned it from BTS 😅😅😅😅🤣💜
So basically RM is dirty minded in all of them and jimin likes showing his chest and um the other just look 😏👀 so um yeah 😅🤣
"namjoon: “wait, something keeps dangling” I DIED"
Once Jin shows us his other side bad boy kinda side it'll be the end for us all.. imagine him ripping his shirt off on stage 💥💥👑
Others:Talking dirty things Jin:HEY. STOB IT!😂💜
0:05 RM is like : thanks me later 😆😆
lol 5:25 jin looks like he gonna throw up lmao
Please Jin's fan comment me I want how many Jin's fan are her  JIN is the only pure soul here
"Jungkook: ""my name is Jungkook, the international playboy ""   Rm: ""that's my boy""     me; absolutely !!!"
5:31 I read banana 🍌 instead of bandana and was so confused lol
Me: Jimin is an INNOCENT angel Jimin: Sikeeeee!! Also Me: Im so happy for that girl 😂
jungkook : international playboy lady in the back : 👀🙄  4:10 😂😂💀
3:50 Jin looks like a girl who's forced by some gangsters😂😂
"""She will be lying in the bed"" -Kim Namjoon  ""When she screams, I will light the candles and we will go out""-Jeon Jungkook   ...im sorry, what- 😳🌚🗿🤠✋   also...  ""Wait a second, something keeps dangling-""-Kim Namjoon  Joonie i- 💀🗿"
Jin is the only purest out there😂💜
Jin is the only pure soul there 😂  Omg thanks for the likes ❤  Nuuuuu ways I got this many likes. Thank you guys
I never wanted to be a teacher so bad- 👁👄👁👌 2:58
Us: Namjoon probably has the dirtiest mind of the 7 boys Meanwhile Namjoon : I'm so PURE 🌝
Nobody can trust a cute and sweet person. For example: our Jiminie
4:18 did anyone notices 😂 tae licks his tounge  When EVERYONE'S was complementing Jimin  He was totally whipped for him 😂😂😂
Please Jin's fan comment me I want how many Jin's fan are her
"3:37 ""the workroom's computer keeps getting viruses"" LMFAOOOO AND THAT'S THE TEA 🍵"
*Jikook 🤝 namjin* Ready to risk it all  *Yoongi 🤝 hobi* An open book
"Personally, the clip where jimin was ""looking at the girls bre$t"" , I don't think he was, I think he was looking at her, to see what was happening, and I think he was smirking, trying not to laugh, I don't know if it's only me, but I laugh when someone is crying (sometimes) I'm not ok 😭"
I have a feeling jin and tae is dirty minded of camera everytime someone else i mean we already know others
"1:01 Jimin:""Hahahahahahah"" and not realize his right hand lands at wrong place  Me:""nooooo babyyy""(jungkook 'bts in the soop' part)"
*Everybody want Seokjin* 💜
How many worldwide handsome fans here.....
0:04 Joon said ✨ur welcome ✨
They should take the responsibility for making their whole fandom dirty-minded
Jin is soo innocent and pure soul in the group
"2:51, Namjoon cringing and fangirling at Jimin flirting with a teacher is pure gold 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭💜💜💜"
"0:06 Jin: will u hang out with me if i wore something like this everyday??  Rm: Yeah..but i wont talk to you....... Jin: okey, stop right there  (bcz it's filmed) Namjin love:):):)"
The first Namjin moment is so underrated.  “Like I would hang out with you... but I won’t talk to you”  And Jin going “alright I’m gonna stop you there”
Ok but tell me why do I think this is real Other members: Too shy to show their abs Jimin: HI BICH YOU LIKE MY ABS
The first clip Namjoon was like: Your welcome 😌
"👑💜🥴RM and Jin, looking so got damn delicious, at the beginning!!! A complete meal, them two are!!!🥵💜👑"
WE SHOULD ALL SAY THANKYOU TO NAMJOON 😭✊ (0:03)
Why is Namjoon always there when there's something about dirty things... Is it weird that my heart flutter when he's like that...
“the only thing on your bum is hotness.” “what a line.” 😭
Tae pronunciando sex porn star en vez de saxophonist 😂
We all know that the most dirty mind is RM...🌝
4:37 the girl filming sounded like she was gonna pass out lmao and honestly same
I love that namjoon is so open to Army. He can't hide anything. BTS ARMY is family. They are boys. And We Army are the most dirty ones. I know it. This video will hit 1M in no time.
RM; ' wait a second something keeps dandling' I CANT NAMJOON
Jung Kook: 'My name is Jung Kook.....I am' RM: 'National'..... Jung Kook: 'I am international playboy'...... RM: 'That's my boy'......   Really Jung Kook is a international playboy 😂
Jimin is....... Well the friend with cute face and a dirty mind🤣
jimin is very N.A.U.G.H.T.Y. 😂😂😂😂
"so basically it's namjoon , jimin and a little bit of v are the dirty minds of the group 😂😂  edit : so in conclusion the dirty minded line is rm, j hope , jimin  and in secretly:  jungkook and suga  the pure but flirty ones : v and jin got it 😂😂💜  thnx for likes"
8:32 jhope didn't get it 🤣🤣 honest boy
Baby Jin and Kookie is so innocent 🥺💜💜
6:25 shy taetae bcos of holding hands me: dead
Ahhh poor jinnie 😂so innocent
1:50 LMAO look at jungkook
“Something keeps dangling” Me: And what do you think is dangling RM?🙃🙃🙃
Look at 1:20 no hate but Yoongi looks like a duck here 🦆LMFAO  Me: *Screenshots* Meme time ☺️
"BTS watching this on their private account like: 👁👄👁 Also BTS: ""Yaa are we not allowed to do what you do?? Staring at our *thighs* when we're wearing tight leather jeans in a concert-"""
3:13 poor Tae baby 😂😂
9:23  I laughed so hard on this. 🤣
Namjoon is that smart decent  friend in front  of your parents who is really naughty in front of his friends.
0:34 V's reaction was priceless😂
I like Jin the most
Jimin and RM are the real perverts 😂😅
When namjoon replied to jk saying that’s my boy after he said international playboy that killed me😭😭😭😭
7:41  jhoooope : YeAh  YeAh oh yeaH aH YeAh   Me: mmhmm 👁👄👁 its seducing man !!!!
"Kookie: ""INTERNATIONAL PLAY BOY "" ( for him )  Army's ""INTERNATIONAL PLAY BUNNY 🐇🐇🐇"" ( for army ) 😂😂😂😂😂"
0:04  Rm:Army would see this Jin:I would like to see their reaction  Me: *Dies*
Jin's laugh 🤣🤣😂😂😂 heh heh heh 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
"""I will hang out with you....""   ""But i wont talk to you""     Yes, namjoon cant get anymore obvious than that 😈"
Tae : hey namjoon hyung is there something on my bum ? Namjoon : the only thing on your bum is hotness  Tae : *gets shocked & speachless*   Me : *starts laughing*   Mom : silence !!!
"I wanna say, RM had the dirtiest mind🤤🤤😇😜😝"
Jimin’s that one kid thinks everything is dirty 😂
02:52 WHY HAVE I NEVER SEEN THIS CLIP BEFORE
Soft stan: BTS can't harm us Hard stan: **shows the vdo**
at 4:10 I couldn't stop laughing cause when Jungkook says International playboy the lady is like what
Namjoon is the flirty and dirty minded partner and jin the shy and flustered one.. #namjin
Jin being confused at 5:25-5:27😂😂
Jimin the dirtiest mind😏 and jin the pure soul😉
0:07 joonie actually said they wouldn't be talking if jin dressed like that while hanging out with him KJSHFKSJDFKS GOODBYE
jin is a literal traditional mannn omg he concern with his dad jokes only 😂🤟
0:04 thank u namjooniee🌝😂
0:05  Wait..... Did RM just bowed us after showing Jin's chest ?!? Lolll
"Jimin = Everyone , next time, if you were to choose me I will show you not the top , but the bot .... Bottom   ...................... 😵😵😵😵😱😱😱😱😱😱"
The fact that I can't see Jin at 8:24 but I can hear him laughing his lungs out.😂😂

BIgHIT: *Act Normal At awards Shows* BTS: *Not Today*
"It’s not an award ceremony without BTS checking zippers, mics in members faces, jumping behind hosts, just being themselves 😂😂😂"
Tae learnt his life lesson of checking zippers and now he is teaching his members too...🤣🤣🤣

"Jin:its live  Hobi: really  Tae: has everyone zipped there pants yet? Tae,jungkook,jin: **zipper** Jin:**turns around to fix it** Tae be like I'm not making that mistake again 🤣🤣🤣"
"""Moa-ah, Your father received the award"" 😂"

Who notice that Red Dress Group girl was going to give yoongi a high five but yoongi turn back and then clap😂😂 at 8:03😂😂😂
This is live!  Everyone checking their zipper in national TV.... LoL
"Never failed to make us laugh, I miss you boys😭❤️"
V : have everyone zipped their pants up? Jin : oh! No I am not wait ah minute  Jin situation: 😶
5:54 - 6:02 jimin nd especially Taehyung habit of seeing the results nd peeking into script... LMAO...why they behave like this .. that's the reason why I love him

And then there is RM regretting life's decision of becoming a leader🤣
only j-hope and jimin confident in there pant  0:27 .I am dying.

I like Jin's reaction whenever Camera is focusing on him..😂😂
The funniest moment is when jin asking jungkook to feed him and jungkook making fun of it  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 really I died of laughter at that time   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Am i the only one who's having the second hand embarrassment like ""YES THAT'S MY BESTIES BUT SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW THEM"""
8:36 Suga's laugh😍😍😍

"Dia 1: me deshidraté y casí no logro ir a la par.  Dia 2: aunque aun me cuesta, sé que  lo voy a lograr.  Dia 3: Ay, dios casi tiro a la borda todo. Pero me puse firme y la hice. Dia 4: wey, al menos ya no sudo tando. Dia 5: completado. Día 6: ya no me acuerdo porqué empecé pero weno, se sigue. Día 7: help me. Día 8: ya cumplí mi meta. Aún así seguiré haciendo la rutina sin contabilizarlo en este comentario. Meta: no ahogarme en mi propio sudor (hecho) e ir al ritmo del chico. Se ven los resultados, y también se sienten es muy lindo!!"

Who feels emotional and have lil tears while listening to the song? Is it only me?
"Love You All💜 BTS for your beautiful voice. I always enjoy your songs while working and sleeping  (RM,Jin, JK, Jimin, V, Suga and J. Hope). Thank you for this playlist."
"Omg! This playlist inspires me more. Love BTS they are my HEALING medicine. I'm 65 yrs old and I'm very proud of my boys success. These boys are very humble even though they are all billionaires. They still love to eat their favorite food ramen. Everytime they go for a tour you will always hear that they miss ramen and their pork belly. Even they don't win the Grammy, they already know that ARMY'S enough for them. BTS  love their ARMY'S so much and ARMY'S love their BTS as well. I wish Grammy will change this coming year. I was disappointed though, but I believe that Grammy will realize that they make a big mistake in their life. These boys will succeed more and will produce more good music that will booze the economy not only in Korea but all over the world. Their music inspires a lot of people specially young generations. Wishing you the best BTS, stay sweet and humble as you are. Once again, I am so very proud of you guys. Love you all so much!!!!!! #borahae #godblessbts #4everbts I💜U 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"

"Oh my gosh, Telepathy is so funky! I LOVE it!! This is my first time hearing that one. Thanks for sharing this playlist! Sarangheyo! 💜"
These guys are genesises of music I’m a 44 year old single mum but I love these guys their tunes just make u instantly make u feel good. Inspirational 95 percent of their tracks never get old u never get sick of listening they give u the same feeling each time as they did when u first heard it.  Last thing just hope as they mature they don’t lose the same vibe they bring I’m a mature woman and I absolutely love their vibe.  Love you BTS x
방탄 최고
"노래가 너무 좋다~~. 노래 들으면서 컴터 작업 일하다 보면 어느새 날 밤을 세게 된다~ 에고 내 나이 벌써 쉰을 향해 가고, 아침이 밝으면 출근해야 하는데ㅠㅠ 근데 노래가 너무 좋잖아..."

"When Hobi leads a Dance break, it's gonna be part of history."
"things you could watch forever: burning fire, falling water, and dancing J-Hope"
j-hope is the beat
6:42 See why he's a Main Dancer and Performance Leader. He looks very effortless but still hitting every goddamn beat!
(insert suga's voice: jhooooooooooooooooooooooope)💜💜💜💜
J-hooooooooooooooope  Nobody but you only in my eyes you’re amazing dance skills always amazes me
I can’t get tired of watching him dance.
J-hope is a dance *LEGEND* ✨👑
"When he dances, he makes it look like gravity can’t keep him on the ground. And each of his movements are nuanced.  I can never keep my eyes off him. No matter how far back they put him."
J-Hope is the Master of Dance and Perfection💜💜💜😎🏆
He’s one of the best dancer I’ve ever seen. He’s crazy good at everything.
"His control  over moves,  Sharpness, smoothness in moves.. He makes the dance look easy.. amazing dancer j-hope"
"The dance break with J-hope in front will always become legendary, just keep my words this is true 👍"
It is really rare for hobi to be center in their whole history😳but it really fire when hobi is center😍😍😍😍😍😱😱😲😎😎😎
j-hope no necesita del baile  El baile necesita ser representado por j-hope 👏😎
JHOPE JHOPE JHOPE! WHERE WOULD WE BE WITHOUT YOU AND YKUR AMAZING DANCE MOVES!!!
👏👏👏j-hope is very very good performer dancer singer much appreciated all videos and hes a cutie ✌💜💜✌💜💜✌💜💜✌🎶🎧💜
History will remember Hobi as one of the all-time great dancers.
EXTRA PLUS ORDINARY!!!!
와 진짜 제이홉 너무 멋있어요  진짜 무대에서 호비 센터 중심으로 댄브 하는거 많이보고싶어요 진짜 다르네 달라  제이홉 센터가 진리네요  근데 회사만 그걸 모르네 제이홉을 센터로 세워야 하는게 맞는거구만 멜뮤서도 다마댄브로 가장 놀라움과 감탄과 탄성을 지르게한게 바로 제이홉이였구만 진짜 최고중 최고이심👍👍
A sight for sore eyes our main dancer
He makes it look like he doesn’t have any bones in his body - smooth and beautiful!
Please post this in English. This deserves more views and I'm sure there are reactors who'd love to react to it as well.
"Thanks for a very nice video showcasing Jhope excellent dancing skills...Nobody can surpass his style of dancing,he danced with grace and swag.He is the best and multi talented!"
Thank you for your hard work so much
jhope owns the stages. hes awesome 👍🏻❤️❤️
HOBI!!!!! WOW!!!! OMG!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg thank you!! Hooray!!! The footage is so great but your editing is wonderful! Thank you for your work and for sharing!
저 멋짐을 누가 과연 흉내낼수있을까???? 아무런 효과도 조연들.소품이 없어도 실력과 스웩으로 무대를 채우는 너. 그래서 넌 입으로 얘기하지않고 실력으로 널 증명한다!
Wish I could get to see more of j-hope center ... hopefully next comeback.
제이홉의 마이클잭슨춤ᆢ이날  끝내줬지.  단 몇초댄스로 전세계 50 여개나라 실트를 씹어먹었으니ᆢ 이런게 진짜 제이홉이지.
Te amooooooo jhope 💜🐁💜
You have done all ARMIES around the world the hugest favor by making this compilation. Thank you! I love it!
"호비 제대로 평가해주세요 춤, 노래, 랩,표정, 성실성, 책임감 실물깡패. 잘 웃고... 뒤에 꽁꽁 숨기지 말고 센터에 많이 세워 주세요"
🕺🏆💖 What beautiful young men. Killer ( King 👑 )
I didn’t know I needed a video like this in my life. 😍🤺
Does this man have any bones in his body!!  He's a genius.
J hopeeeeeeeeeeeee
Jung Hoseok 🔥🔥🔥 Luv u❤
"JHope, you are my inspiration in terms of dance. I respect you for your talent and you in BTS."
"Wow JHopeeee 💜 amo como bailas, eres el mejor bailarín, alegras mis días con tan solo verte ... Me gustaría tatuarme el breakdance de dynamite ¡Me encanta!"
He's dancing with his soul ~A KING👑
역시  호석은 역대급  춤실력  누구도 넘볼수 없는  넘사벽~~
"Cuando J-Hope baila, hace estremecer el escenario y los corazones de army. Hermoso mi solecito!"
It’s a treat to watch j-hope perform
Jhope is such a talented dancer. Itz so fascinating to watch him dance. I m so impressed wif him. 👏👏👏
제발 호비무대할때 조명이랑 카메라좀 신경써주세욧!!!! 우리 호비 잘 하는거 다 잘 볼 수 있게!
Hobi 💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
Thank you for the great dances. I hope you good year .Dances are so beautiful.
"Awesome, Amazing, so perfec. He is the best."
"JHOPE, Extraordinario bailarín!!!!! Desde los comienzos con BTS."
es increible ver como han crecido nuestros chicos BTS y no me refiero solo a la edad sino a sus talentos!!!! JHope es un bailarín maravilloso y creativo!!!!
Непревзойденно! Просто глаз не отвести!
영상 편집 감사합니다💜  호비 춤 너무 좋아요. 무대를 보면 춤을 너무 사랑하는게 온 몸에서 느껴져 몰입되고 기분이 좋아지는것 같아요. 카메라가 뒤통수를 비쳐도 표정이 보인다고 할까? 앵글에 잡히지 않는 곳에서도 최선을 다하고 더 발전시키는 그 모습 존경스럽습니다.
"Jhoooope,  esse cara dança pra valer"
Omg I love you jhopeeeeeeee😍😍😍😍😍😍
👏👏👏👏👏❤️ J hope  🥳
빅히트 !!! 우리호비 분량 늘려줭 ❤️❤️❤️
He is the best!!!! Awesome!
오~~~~감사합니다 🙏  우리호비 이쁜호비 오늘 실컷 보네요😍 우리호비 너무 잘해 오늘 또 한번 반하고 갑니다 사랑해 제이홉 🙆‍♀️💚💜🐿
You're the best 👍👍👍fabulous performer ever ♥️♥️♥️
멋지다 제이홉💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜예술작품보는거같아요 좋은영상 감사드리구요 구독자많이늘어서 우리호비 보물인거 더많은사람들이 알았으면 좋겠어요🙏
나같은 사람이 봐도 홉이 춤은 화려하면서 깔끔하고 뭔가 힘있게 느껴지면서 아름답고... 그냥 미친다😇💜🥰😍
Pleasure to watch. Thank you
"You did it again, what a greatest edition from my love Hobi,  thanks, I can stop watching him again and again and again, he is my mantra of hope."
나만 바보엿군 난 지민이가 춤을 제일 절추는줄 알엇는데... 요번에 확실히알음 재이홉이 最後 쵝오!!!!!!!!!!!!!♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
미소 뛰우면서 춤의 고수 제이홉 신도 옆으로 비켜갈 것 같네요.❤💖💖👏👏👏
영상 편집 감사해요 무한반복 시청하겠네요 홉이 춤은 힘있고 화려하고 유연하고 느낌이 풍부하고 또 자연스럽고 섹시해요
The most needed compilation to me💚🔥. Thanks👏😁
"우리 제이홉 정말 자랑스럽고 항상 너무 응원하고 사랑해❣️ 말로 다 표현할수 없이 모든걸 다 기대이상으로 잘해주고 춤 뿐만아니라 랩, 작사작곡 등 모든 분야에서 능력이 흘러넘치고.. 그저 최고ㅠ"
"난 요즘 울 호석이가 넘넘 자랑스럽다~~♡♡ 혼자 이슈가 되는 것을 좋아하지는 않지만, 그가 자신의 진가를 드러내고, 어떤 재능을 지녔는지를.. 어떤 인성의 소유자인지를 알아주고 인정해주는 분들이 많아져서 넘 행복하네요~ 쭉쭉 비상해 나아가야~♡"
우선 Hoseok94님 항상 감사드려요  우리 호비는 항상 최고의 무대를 보여주죠 빅힛의 카메라가 그지같을뿐 아 2024년 언제 오나요 흐르는 시간이 아쉬울뿐 이런 어나더레벨을 수납하고 수준 낮은 거나 카메라 잡고 이젠 무대 보는게 창피할지경
OMG! Jhooope!! I could watch this over and over! So talented. The lengths he can take his body to seems limitless. And big ups to the editing too it was done so well 👏🏾👏🏾
Oh wow whenever the camera focuses on him ya know its gonna be good! Legend!♥️
제이홉은 비트 쪼개는 게 아주 죽여줌 강약 확실 물 흐르는 듯한 연결 동작
호비 춤은 넋놓고 보게 되는듯ㅠ 시간이 지날수록 더 여유로워지고 더 잘하고... 여기서 얼마나 더 잘할려구그래ㅠㅠ 호비 최고💜 근데 이 영상보니까 그지같은 카메라와 조명땜에 호비가 그렇게 잘 췄는데도 제대로 안보인게 은근 많아서 빡침ㅠ 암튼 늘 좋은 영상 감사해요~~~
So well edited. Tq. I love this man and his moves. His passion is something else!!!
"ESTE es el estilo de J Hope, el  dance break, y lo hace de maravilla, a mi me encantaría que mi solecito tuviera su propio canal de baile donde invitará a todos aquellos bailarines brutales que se buscan la vida por la calle 🤧 tanto talento sin ser conocido, amaría que mi solecito lo hiciera."
정호석 너무 열심히 노력하고 잘해요.
너무 잘해서 잘한다고 말하기도 입아픈 호비. 호비가 센터에 서면 뭔가 중심을 딱 잡아주는 느낌. 칼군무가 더 빛이 나게 해주는 듯.
세상에 좋은말은 다 같다 표현해도 부족한 울 호비 항상 건강하고 꽃길만걷길 바라는맘 간절합니다❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Спасибо за присланное видео. Танцы Хосока заставляют нас все больше и больше восторгаться им.🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🕺🏼🕺🏼🕺🏼💜💜💜
홉아 진짜 평생 춤 춰주라 진짜로....춤선 ㄹㅇ쾌감 느껴지고 너무 잘해 보면서 더 열심히 춤춰야겠다고 자극 받는 멤버야ㅠㅜㅜ 춤 배워보고 싶다 안무팀장님ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅠ
Just beautiful! TYSM for that!  J-Hope = The 8th Wonder of the World! Encore!! Encore!!
"great, now i'm a fan of you"
정말 제이홉은..다시 없을 천재..ㅠㅠ
The Footwork is amazing! Absolutely love it. all those extra steps and movements...Ah!.. but close-ups really do no good at times.
Our sunshine is the king of dance.   But Mochi in that blue shirt looks stunning.
잘난 제이홉♡
호비 너무 좋다. 호비 보면 행복해져요. 어쩜 제가 좋아하는 무대를 쏙쏙. 감사^^
호석이 분량 까먹는 빅힛 반성해야
비타민뽕  정호석의 무대!!  이렇게  보고 있으니 너무 행복 하네요.... 멋진 편집 너무 감사드립니다.  행복감 충만하고 갑니다.
"That was amazing & so fulfilling to watch. When Hobi takes the center, it’s amazing how he shines even brighter because he’s already so awesome 🌞. His movements are awing & his facials are killer even when he isn’t center. Thank you so much for sharing 😁. Borahae 💜"
Спасибо за лучшее видео
새해 선물을 주셨네요 감사합니다.🙏
That's great
"카메라 따위가 제이홉의 입체적인 춤을 다 보여줄 수 없지! 우리나라 발카가 너무 많아서 내 생눈으로 보고싶다!!!!! 보이지 않는 곳에서도 제이홉은 미치게 열정적으로, 프로답게, 춤에 진심을 보여준다구♡ 믿고 보는 정호석 무대!"
ego 안무 영상 찍어줫으면 좋겠다.... 제발....

Jin is a man who teases everyone except himself😂😂
"BTS relationships are so much more wholesome when members are not aggressively shipped, but their chemistry is appreciated."
"1:23 the fact that Jin is teasing Jimin with the rice cake but Jin literally has a ""Just Eat It"" badge(?) on his shirt sends😂😂😂"
"Jin's relationship with six of them is always cute and fun to watch. Because he's such a soft and kind hyung, the members' attitude towards him is also the same 💜"
Jin is so unique and  different I really🤗💕💕💞💞💞💞😍💞💞 love and adore him the most
Jin and jimin have a really lovely friendship - when it's just them two they're always very complimentary to each other and jimin is always saying how much he admires jin. When others are with them they take on a more jokey role but it's still very wholesome and lovely. I agree with the earlier comments that it's just nice to ship the friendships rather than make them romantic
Jimin is so cute while playing with jin .he is our baby along with jinnie
Everytime jinmin fight its just full of laugh and its a comedy 😂😂  Jin always there to make sure Jimin is happy and eat well 😍  Stan JINMIN for a whole happy life !!
Im a loyal taejinnie who has an extremely weak spot for jinships🥺
Jinmin is one of my favorite duo next to jinkook.🤧💜
"i see jin and jimin, i click"
Jimin once said that Jin taught him how to be happy and just enjoy life. I just love the bond of this two.
Jinmin the cutest and funniest duo.
I am first without notification  I love you jin I love you bunglie jin I love you seokjinies I love you BTS  I love Armys who loves and respects jin as Jin stans
"Jinmin is a very beautiful shipp, it should be very popular."
"6:46 When Jimin became a baby, he whined to his brother because he had been tricked😂 He is very cute😍☺😭"
"☺The funny side of Jimmin was at its best if he is tease or joke by Jin.😁 This' proven  that the two were very close with eo.😄😄  As what Jin said before, he only tease, joke to those who responded to him.😃😃  Thats why #kookjinmin are my fav chaotic trio😍"
Jimin's reactions when teased by Jin are too cute I can't lmaooooo  1:52 rapper Jin lol
I love jinmin so cute lovely together Tom and Jerry couple always teasing each other bickering having fun together 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
They are close. You tease someone close 😊
I love Jin’s “Just Eat It” Nike-esque pin at 1:09! 😂😂😂
I love when they tease each other without other getting angry & instead laugh like kids!!  Jinmin duo helps me to find more ways to tease my siblings and friends without making them angry
2:10 and 6:22 awww Are my fav.. episode of run BTS!  Jimin was really innocent and cute in these episode 😙
I feel insulted that I play against you😂😂😂😂👍💜
"""for a cinematic experience"" jajaja that was funny 😅"
"Such a cute video! ☺️ I was just thinking of finding more Jin and Jimin videos, so the timing of this video was perfect! I find their interactions so cute, like little brother and big brother. I’m an older sibling and I like to tease my little brother the same way, so I can relate 😂"
Jiinmin best💓🔥💜
"JIN 'S BIAS = JIMIN JIMIN 'S BIAS = JIN , these 2 are real close, choose to spend own time with each other are each other's sounding board for serious stuff and also each other's happy pills. I seriously adore them. There is just pure love there."
I love jinmin so much ❤️😂😂
The softest duo xD
"2:16 lifting him( jin) like he's an flowers petal 😁😂  Wow jimin is so strong my little Baby is so light that Jk also lift  him like he's an small pin lol😂 ""strong yet light jinnie✊"""
Love JINMIN Love BTS
I love your content videos! Thank you for making videos about Jin and BTS! We love it so much!🤧💜
"2:06 this is such a beautiful moment....but this clip here is not share fully....when Jin was wiping his forehead with Jimin's sweatshirt, and Jimin smashed him on the neck softly then Jimin went and brought some tissues for Jin so that Jin can wipe the sweat property....it was heartwarming for me 💜🥺🤧"
4:32 Ofcourse how can we miss iconic Harry Potter tease by wwh after a ping pong game.
Still now i laugh my ass ok at this part.....3:44
I WANT SEOKJINIE TO GIMME HE'S CONFIDENCE FOR ONE DAY..😂🥺
"Jin is always happy,and I guess that’s why I love him and he’s funny too,he’s make me laugh and happy"
OMGee the flashback is so funny
My favorite part is when Jin gave Jimin the card and Suga was laughing at them. Jimin is very cute I love him.
동생들 장난 잘 받아주고 또 장난 잘 걸어주고 은근히 6명 동생 다루는 스킬도 다 달라서 멤버 모두와 케미가 좋은 우리 석진이. 정말 케미요정이죠♡ 지민이한테 당하는 다음 편도 기대하겠습니다ㅋㅋㅋ 늘 좋은 영상 너무 고마워요~

Oh gosh I really can't stop my laugh... Borahae  bts.
6:45 😭jimin's voice is very cute
Jimin's guide to teasing Jin will not be as successful. Jin is a stinker and Jimin is easy to pick on lol. I love Jin's sense if humor.
jinmin😪❤️
I just love how chaotic these 2 are.. I'm just baffled on their teasing and of what a mess they truly both are..haahahaha..🤔🙃😂🤣🙈😵😉🤭😁

Song: Lovesick Girls Artist: Black Pink Album: The Album
Bts nomer 1
This performance will go down in history as one of the best award show performances. Ever.
"When you see the fan cam of this, after the lights went down they looked like they were going to completely collapse. They give it everything."
RM starting this with Persona is why Hitman Bang hired him on the spot and formed BTS around him.
They’re already so strong individually you can only imagine how it’s like when they’re all 7. I agree with the people suggesting you to react to more of their live performances!!! Their energy together is just insane. On top of all that intensity they were also singing live I would love to have their stamina
All of the solo dances were prerecorded *except* for Jimin's. He wanted to do it live on stage because he felt he would give a better performance.
"RM is a straight up rapper. He started as an underground rapper, that’s how he was discovered. One of the Big Hit (his entertainment company) in-house producers was impressed by a performance of his, he brought it forwards to Bang Si-Hyuk (the CEO) and they invited RM to audition. He of course, passed (that was around 2010) and they decided to create a hip hop group around him, that’s how much faith they had in this kid’s ability with the pen, a paper and a beat.   Suga followed. He was a fellow underground rapper at the time and he got signed through a hip-hop contest held by Big Hit where you win cash as a prize. (Fun fact, this contest is held annually by Big Hit, it’s called Hit It Auditions and when it happens armys are always curious if perhaps they might find a diamond in the rough as they did with Suga almost a decade ago).   Then J-Hope was signed (he was an underground dancer at the time, he absorbed that love for hip hop like a sponge with the help of RM and Suga and developed as a rapper). There were a few other rappers that were rumoured to debut with the boys (as the group was initially a rap one) but some left or some remained as in-house producers.   Later on, around 2011-2012, the four vocalists (JungKook, Jin, V and Jimin) joined the company and group one by one and so the initial plans changed and they debuted as a idol group, but they were still very much hip-hop heavy in their music and sound (as well as in mindset as they’ve written and helped produce their songs since pre-debut days). As time went on they’ve started experimenting with other music genres and creating fusion music.  RM has two mixtapes to his name: RM (2015) and Mono (2018) plus countless singles or features with other artists Suga also has two mixtapes under the pseudonym Agust D: Agust D (2016) and D-2 (2020) plus countless features and producing credits on other artist’s music. J-Hope has one mixtape to his name: Hope World (2018)   All mixtapes can be found for free on BTS’s soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/bangtan  Lyric translations can be found here: https://doolsetbangtan.wordpress.com/solo-projects/"
SUGA did all that with a shoulder injury he got pre-debut and has been causing worse and worse pain the more the years went by fortunately he recently got surgery and now he's healing
"Oh, do pause and talk. it's especially gratifying when professionals and experts reacting to BTS, and they pause or add text on the screen to to explain certain aspects of what the members are doing on a video. professionals' insights make layman fans see another facet of BTS. Although, better avoid talking over video. We want to hear your voice and the video clearly. Btw, try practice videos and behind the scenes. You get to see more focused capture of their movements. Some of them even have funny versions where they wore costumes to practice.  Have fun and take care~"
"jimin's solo performances in mma 2018 and mma 2019 is so iconic, mma 2020 paid special tribute to them by showing pictures of each performance in their ""memorable performances wall"", two of the few that are solo performances by an idol."
"That is Jimin, he does the contemporary dance because he was graduated from art school and he also has a black belt for taekwondo and also  shodan for kendo"
SONGS:  1. RM - Persona ( MOTS 7) 2. Boy In Luv 3. Boy with Luv  4. Mikrososmos   Solo Stages: These are all Remixes  1. V- No More Dream ( Debut Song) 2. Jin- Danger  3. Jimin - I Need You  4. Suga - Fire  5. JK- Save Me  6. JHope - Fake Love 7. RM - Dionysus  DIONYSUS  The dance break is a remix of N.O
BTS are seriously one of the best if not the best performers ever .
"""I'm getting god of war vibes.....but in a suit."" I DONT KNOW WHY THIS MADE ME LAUGH AS HARD AS IT DID BUT IT DID 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
JHOPE HAS SUCH CHARISMATIC STAGE PRESENCE LIKE HE CAN GO FROM CUTE SMILEY IN BOY WITH LUV TO INTENSE IN DIONYSUS
"Jimin’s solo is amazing and even more so when you realise he was the only one who performed it live, amazing 🔥"
42:17 oh they hosted  MMA on their concert 😂
Jimin's I NEED U solo dance performance was the highlight of the show. 🌟🌟🌟 His stage wasn't broadcasted pre recorded one but the only real time live solo stage of BTS
Someone on Twitter that does contemporary said that it’s hard to work with like a fabric prop like that since it’s light and like hard to control it’s movements but Jimin does it very well with the way he throws it and uses it to creat a better feel for the dance.
"J-Hope's solo stage that used the dance crew and,  as you said, popping choreo like from 2010s, is a reflection on his time in the dance crew neuron. He was on their jr team and then the youngest member in the main team in high school. They were well known and won a lot of competitions! I loved this stage despite how badly it was filmed/lit. It really was a nod to his roots and I love that. 💜 I've commented this before but j-hope is BTS's dance leader/dance captain and reviews with them all their performances & choreography. Their Performance Director calls him Captain Jung. Also CONGRATS ON THE KICKSTARER. I wanted to contribute but I was waiting for my next paycheck. Thrilled for you all!"
the fact that they dancing but their voice is NOT shaking..legends!!!
"""I dont know what they are singing, but that song gives me hope, in the way that they are singing"" *SAY IT LOUDER DUUUDE*"
you can watch their dance practice for this award show in Bangtantv. they have a corner for each dancer so it would be clearer/easier for you to see their individual movements.
"*J-HOPE’S DUALITY IS NO JOKE. HE CAN SWITCH FROM CUTE, ADORABLE TO HOT IN A SECOND.💀 UNBELIEVABLE😍😳💜*"
"Hi Emeroy, MMA shown prerecorded of their solos except for Jimin @ 29:50 tho they still performed live on stage while prerecorded ones were playing. From fancams, they're all in black (Dionysus attire) while performing live on stage."
I'm pretty sure he is in love with Hobi's smile.
Hahaha I can’t believe I just sat here for whole hour watching you react to them. But I’m glad you uploaded this. I wasn’t able to watch the live. Also I’m glad that you enjoyed it. This performance was really the talk of the town. So was the one from 2018
"Dude. That was an hour well spent. I've been watching this the past few days. Start to finish strong. I especially loved J-hope's popping, JK in the water and of course our ethereal Jimin. He was trained in contemporary at a performing arts high school and in addition to having a black belt in Taekwondo he has some training in Kendo. They are all unique but go together so magically."
"22:43 Jin the guy you paused on. I love that you brought that up. He always portrays such great emotion when performing. You were talking about imposter syndrome, he himself said that he has been experiencing imposter syndrome lately."
"Yes, he dose have marshal arts skills. He is a completed artist!"
So glad you enjoyed this performance. Yep welcome to a mini BTS concert and btw there is an award show. 😂💜
YOU TOTALLY SHOULD TO THE MAMA 2019. IT WAS GREAT
I love your reaction!!! Thanks for reacting to the whole thing and not skipping
"you should 100% check out their 2018 MMA performance 🎭 i’d be interested to what you think about the Fake Love intro! also the IDOL performance at the end was absolutely insane (it also had solo stages, but only the dance line)  also it is my second fave performance (after this one) as it was FULL of their culture and showing that they won’t change who they are in a mind blowing performance, the title track that they had that year (IDOL) was all about their culture, and showing that they r never gonna change or become ‘westernised’ due to all of their international success. the songs lyrics are great too, main one being ‘You can’t stop me loving myself’ !"
Well these boys are called legends for a reason! hahahaha they always go hard on stage like it's their last and it f shows! The 2nd song was from 2014 btw and it still slaps!! after 6 years!! And dude you haven't even touch the surface of their insane discography hahahhaa so good luck! heheheehe hope you have fun looking at the boys' sick discography+perf+stage presence cuz they are a whole damn package man! I've been following them since 2015 and they still get me hyped every single time they come back with a new album and they still make my heart race cuz they are truly one of a kind bro! This perf was honestly one of the best ever from them!!!  They even produce their own songs too so they are truly artist of a another scale!  And Boy With luv was meant for the fans to dance along too because they know that their choreo is very hard to master so that's why they made an easier choreo for this song.
"This is just the best, lost count of the times I've watched it, looking forward to your reaction, for sure will be watching."
React to The most beautiful life goes on: a story of BTS. IT explained very well their sucess and how everything started!
"I laughed when you said Jimin was Venus in male form! Jimin is a libra, libra is ruled by Venus and a masculine sign! Thought it would be fun to share :)"
It’s like Zeus decided to have a race in his house - quite on point! 😜
"People can say everything they want about BTS , but never ever deny their talent. They have an amazing stage presence and can turn every award show into their concert. You HAVE to watch the other award show performances too they slay every time💜.  And ps: RM and suga were both underground rappers before they got into BTS🤗"
Cannot get over the fact that this performance wasn't a concert but was for an award show 🤯 the power these men hold 🥺 borahae! 💜
This is one of their BEST AWARD SHOW PERFORMANCE! Looking forward to your reaction!
5:51 Emeroy : get someone who can do both Me : only if I could T_T *cries in rm stan aasjklfgdgkj*
Congratulations on hitting your goal Em!
I have seen this so many times but I still learned more about it from you--thank you! 💜
14:20 and 16:10 THATS HOBI. We know his smile brings happiness and boost your serotonin 🥺💕 there's NO WAY you can resist his charm
"I love when Jimin does his contemporary dance, Taekwondo and as a Kedo Master from before BTS.  His body awareness is one of the best I have seen."
You should definitely checkout more Award Performances ❤️ For example bts mama 2018 or mma 2017 :) Would be epic!
You should react to the dance practice for this finale MMA 2019 performance to really see the details of their amazing performance!
"Boy In Luv (First group song of this show that you liked) and Danger are 2 of my favourite dance practices, you'll love them :D"
"You should check out the rehearsal for mma2019, they uploaded it on bangtantv. More clearer version on their movements. 👌"
"Do you think im gonna watch 1 hour vid just cause you are reacting to BTS?  Well, yes, obviously im gonna watch it. Thank you 💜"
The chair thing was about when jimin doesn't get his chair on time and he was sitting in the air for a while and the fact that he didn't know that the chair wouldn't come on time and it was like he knew but it was just him being professional because most people would have fallen backwards not knowing there was no chair
"BTS always make awesome performances. Jimin and J-hope really stole the show, their solos were impressive and they showcased the dance styles that they more dominate. They aren't main dancers of BTS for nothing, they really are the perfect complement and belong to best dancers in the industry. I recommend reacting to MAMA 2019, MAMA 2016 (especially Jimin and J-hope's iconic performance)."
"You would not be the first person to state RM is a legit emcee (or MC) and someone with stage presence. And yep, he was an underground rapper pre-BTS. And like you said, they actually all have stage presence. They all shine, together and individually."
"The chair mistake in Dionysus was in the last part when Jimin's chair was late, he was sitting in the air"
They are also singing Live while dancing 🕺.  💜
"Yeah you're right, they each stand out, you get the perfect balance that IS our BTS💜😁 good reaction, thank you."
I appreciate you listing your credentials...I don’t have to just believe you that you are a dancer.
"That stutter when you first saw Jimin... that's called ""The Jimin Effect"" and is wildly known as unavoidable 😅 Jimin is the most popular idol in Korea and is known as King of Kpop and King of Dance. Jimin's stages always go viral and instantly become everyone's favourite part of the show. He's an unparalleled performer and a dancer of dreams 🤩 I especially loved you saying reaction might be awkward but then being so hype and enjoying it! That's BTS for you, they will give their 150% for every performance and give their all to the fans! They have us ARMY because they are such incredible artists and sincere people  😊 P.S.: and yes! Hobi is always blessing us with his beautiful smile 🥺"
Todas las presentaciones de BTS 💜🎵🎶🇰🇷 son espectaculares y ellos tan profesionales 🥰 los amoooo 💜 Gracias por tu reacción  Saludos 🙋🏻‍♀️🇲🇽
Please react to OLD BTS dance practices!!!!  Danger Boy In Luv N.O. We are Bulletproof Pt2 No More Dream  War of Hormones
"BTS are amazing and their songs, voices and lyrics and dancing and personalities....outstanding"
Thank you always for your professional reaction and also love the fact that you don’t miss even little things which makes huge impact. Devil is in the details. Don’t be shy to contact big hit. I’m sure they will collaborate with you and your crew once COVID clears out. They are actually approachable people. Happy new year!
For someone who's usually hungry these boys never leave me starving like 😃
"Great reaction, but you need to give it up and go down the Rabbit hole. The dance reflects the lyrics. JMO I see this as a throwing down of the gauntlet, a challenge to creativity...what will you do. What can you do? Challenging but an invitation to do more.  BTS IS EXTRAORDINARY.  PLUS they don't  treat their backups as afterthoughts, they are treated as the artist's they are. Thanks, stay well"
Emeroy: God I miss performing.  I know right? They make you wanna get up and dance and learn what they’re doing on stage. It’s infectious.
Please check Taemin's performance in MAMA2020
Nasty MC well there are 3 of them allegedly  The UGH song was superb in last October 2020 online concert  Persona is so entertaining: rm wants you to read about Jung. His middle name is mister president
This is one of their BEST performance that I have seen so far and I am glad to see you enjoy this as much as I did! Are you usually reacting on TWITCH?
Yah finally get to see you reacting one of my fav live performances for them. Legendary!
believe me every detail they put in this every visual everything has meaning and story of itself and it all ties together.. we fans kind of establish to do theories find every easter eggs whenever they have these big stages.. and i think this is one of the reasons why theyre different amongst others.. it's just.. so fun to be their fan
"When I started watching BTS performances just a few months ago, I literally had my hand over my chest because I was so moved and blown away by their talent. And you are right, their individuality stands out even if they are performing as a group."
40:54 I’m sorry Namjoon but I laughed so hard remembering what happened here at this moment 🤣🤣
Wait omg you should also react to their mama 2019 performances it's also a whole show!! all year end performance usually this whole thing with them lol
Watching our BTS stage performance like MMA or MAMA is like watching an awesome  movie that you don't want to end!
Just the maknae playing in the water inside  Martial arts too
Glad to see you enjoy their performance :) That's why we love BTS lol
If you haven't reacted to BTS ON' y'all need to watch it! That's a masterpiece more on dancing💜 waiting for you to react hehe
"Todas as reações que eu vi dessa performance do MMA as pessoas leram o ""Te amo"" no telão."
"Everything in the Dionysus performance had meaning. They really researched their stuff and created a masterpiece. They also used their discography in a timeline as they were progressing.  The point of Map of the Soul was for them to revisit their roots to understand how they got to where they are now in order to move forward. It was mentioned in the performance, who I was, who I am now and who I will be. This performance allowed them to explore all that.  They also had to fill over 40 mins of show since many artists were pulled out of this show due to their companies being idiots so they just gave all that time to BTS."
"Looking forward to your BTS reactions! Their dancing is what first got me caught in their vortex,  then learning about their great messages and personalities. I hope you can react to some of their strongest dance, ON, Dope, Bapsae, Fire, No More Dream, lots and lots of astounding live performances as well as ""dance practices"" where you you can really see the details. Subscribed!"
This is the first time that I actually watched a whole reaction video of bangtan's performance and it was actually an hour long---loved it!
"I was lucky enough to see BTS live at Wembley. I’ve seen a lot of big western artist from Madonna, Lady Gaga etc etc but nothing can prepare you for a BTS concert. These young men are amazing their show was incredible. This performance was out of this world beats the 2017 which I thought was breathtaking. 💜"
"Yeah, all of them are portraying Greek gods with RM being diyonysus himself with his staff.  The lights that come down from the ceiling per member forms cornea borealis (uh idk the name ) but basically the crown that the Greek god gives to his wife that is formed of a constellation made of seven stars. The horses and flowers are to my understanding also to recreate the ancient wedding culture of the Greek gods. Hence the women creating the flower path for Adrienne (wife of Diyonysus ) which they've cleverly portrayed as the the audience or camera view walking up to Diyonysus at the god's table. There's also a theory of the horse man that is infront of the table with a veil is a symbol that comes from another Greek folklore of a man that was humiliated by the the people in power ,rooting back to bts's early careers where they were screwed over by bigger labels. There's more to that but I would be writing a book if I explain all the Easter eggs that BTS have hidden in this entire performance.  It's just fascinating to me that their works can always have so many layers and exploring them doesn't disappoint."
the way they make it feel like their concert and the crowd almost full of army bomb lol
their early songs hit so hard!!! so angsty!!
"There some video about this awards show staff talking about bts after performance backstages, they collapse with some oxygen shit going on. So thank you bts for putting awesome performance."
Everytime you say you miss the stage reminds me how much I miss performing too I miss it so much 😅💜💜💜
J-Hope's stage presence is always captivating
The Energy #Respect . Ive watched this so many times but i still finished the whole 1 hr reaction 🤣🤣🤣 more live reaction of bts pleaseeee 😁
"LOL OMG I Love your reaction...wow you got this Army all hyped up! Thank You , love watching all old/new performances"
Please react to N.O + WE ARE BULLETPROOF PT 2 MAMA performance
"this reaction made me so happy you have no idea.. i love how you notice every little detail, there’s ppl who don’t know how to appreciate art but you never miss anything and that’s something i love the most about your reactions. please react to their concert performances more bc their energy on their own stage among their own fans is something else really, their energy is even more special. i suggest not today, idol, and mic drop live on concert. oh and a little side note, bts took all the biggest awards on this show (4 of them) which no one has ever done before them! looking forward to more reactions💜💜"
"There's this nice video compilation ""BTS Iconic Dance Breaks over the years"" that I think you're gonna like to react to"
I remember sending the link to this performance to the Recording Academy/Grammy’s showing them what a true award show performance really is & what is coming.....weather they want it to or not!
When he finds out the 3 rappers have tons of solo work including free mixtapes....
"Personally, I like their MAMA 2019 performance better, but this is still one of my absolute performances by them 😍💜"
"ME: gonna watch this video in 2 parts, because it's long. Also me: watch everything at once.  This is probably my favorite end of year stage, and once i start watching i cant stop. Also, i appreciate your reactions, thanks for this one."
the thing with them is that they belong on stage.. it's where they rlly shine bc they love it and u can feel that so it's just a great exchange of energy between performer and audience... like man a bts concert is a different universe!! I miss being at one so much!! u can rlly feel their passion and like no wonder they often get emotional and shed a few tears bc damn I would too if I was living that
j-hope's fake love performance is really so lit for me! Please do watch the dance practice on this to see it clearer.
Oooo Kpop kings😍😍😍😍😍

"ESPERO QUE LES GUSTE ESTE ANALISIS! los voy a leer a todos, asi que dejenme comentarios y se los voy a estar contestando"
"5:59 Nadie se reciste al mm,mm,mm de suga"
"Ahora debes escuchar Blue & Grey, es una tremenda joyita"
"Recomiendo mucho que escuches Black Swan, ON y Blood Sweat and Tears. Son canciones que marcan mucho para el fandom. Info aparte; Black Swan habla del amor que tienen como artistas, y del miedo que tienen a perder ese amor por la música y su creación."
"Sere sincera. Vine por la reacción a la canción, pero la parte del final en la que la tocas siempre hace que tus videos sean mejores. 😂"
"Tienes que escuchar “Blue & Grey” de su último álbum, te va a gustar muchísimo. Amo tus videossss 💜"
"POR FAVOORR TENES QUE REACCIONAR A ""FILTER"" DE JIMIN DE BTS Tiene guitarra acústica que por lo que vi te gusta bastante 😅 asique obligado a reaccionarr a este temon 🤗 un saludooo genio"
Análisis de Fake love de bts porfavor
"Te recomiendo que escuches ""airplane pt2"" y ""mic drop"" son 2 estilos diferentes ""mic drop "" es como más rap ya que la letra habla del hate y ""airplane pt2"" es como ritmos latinos y la verdad es una de mis canciones favoritas de bts, además de que esta cantada en japonés"
Quienes pensaron que pondria el mv oficial quedaron asi 🤡  Pd bueno lo que vale es la musica  Es muy linda ajaj ;) ame tu reaccion
"Fake love de bts, utiliza guitarra aunque no es acústica. Te encantará si reaccionas a ella. También deberías reaccionar a sus voces en directo... Son excelentes"
Alguien más ayudó cantando las partes en coreano desde su casa XD? 🥺
"Dios mío nadie habla de como lo hizo demasiado bien al momento de tocar y cantar, aaaaaaa😫"
¿10 días? Y yo que soy bien desesperada. 🤡
Jimin es el que hace las notas mas altas y siempre esta en los coros 💜
"Bueno ya que tenemos tiempo (10 días) Te pondré en contexto : Esta canción habla sobre (como el título lo dice)que la vida continua , incluso en momentos difíciles y diferentes que jamás hemos vivido antes ,la vida va a continuar ,que aunque sea difícil de creer no a cambiado mucho como pensábamos, todo continuara como lo hacíamos antes . Es una canción de esperanza en momentos tan malos como los de ahora . Te recomiendo reaccionar a todo el álbum ""BE"" , que habla de todas la emociones que los chicos sintieron durante esta pandemia ,interpretado en varias canciones originales  Esperare con ansias tu reacción!!"
El que está una octava arriba es mi amado Jimin y en realidad su voz es así la más aguda del grupo
🍊youtube no avisa ni aunque le pongas recordatorio :'v 🍊SI ERA JUNGKOOK!!!!!!!! 🍊La Rap line (primero nombre real y segundo artistico): el primero que rapeo fue  Kin Namjoon(RM) Segundo el del mh mh mh mmmh es Min yoongi(Suga) Y el otro es el de camisa negra Jun Hoseok(j-hope) Vocal line(igual los nombres): Jeon jungkook(jungkook) Kim Seokjin(jin) Park Jimin(jimin) Kim taehyung(V) 🍊Cantas muy bonito✨💜💙 y los acordes con la guitarra quedaron geniales me gusto mucho 🍊Lo explicas genial y gracias porque ayudas a entender mas sobre las canciones 😄👍✨
"Escucha House Of Cards(en vivo, no esta el video official) es de la vocal line ahí se lucen mucho según mi opinion! Muy buen video!"
10 días????? En serio??? Te pasaste con eso 🤣🤣 P/D:  que shampoo usas??? Tenes el pelo más lindo que yo
"Algo para destacar es que Jungkook, quien empieza a cantar fue el ditector de las 3 versiones del vídeo :) gracias por estp, me encantan tus videos"
Cómo que el 2 de enero? Quedé payasa como siempre
"AMO COMO EL REACCIONA, ES TAN DETALLADO LO QUE DICE, ME ENCANTA 💜"
"Yo viniendo a ver el vídeo bien feliz porque acabo de conocer tu canal y Life Goes On es una de mis canciones favoritas y me encuentro que es en 10 días, así quede.🤡 JAHSHAHAHA"
"deberías poner los subtítulos que salía en life goes on ahí entenderás de lo que trata la canción, es mas bonita de lo que crees"
Podrías hacer un análisis de Black Swan es una canción que e verdad es una obra de arte
Reacciona a Blue and Grey es hermosa y tiene mucho de guitarra💜
Reacciona a TXT Blue Hour porfaa ❤️. Faltan 7 días 😆👌🏻.
Tienes que escuchar las cansiones de sus inicios son increíbles. Te recomiendo que escuches la de (We are bulletproof pt2) y la de (Danger)
"7:47 es la inigualable y hermosa voz de JIMIN 💜 tiene canciones como  Lie Promise Serendipity Filter, reacciona a todas pero está wow JIMIN es el que tiene la voz más aguda y altos impresionantes y hay recopilación Te quedo super el cover , me encantó 😍 quiero mi saludito 😁"
"Aprendo mucho con este pibee.. El que tiene las voz más aguda es Jimin, el suele tener la voz mas aire.. Después está Taehyung que tiene la voz más gruesa por decirlo así.. Que es el chico que mencionaste en DNA. La rap line son Suga, RM y j Hope.. Te recomiendo que reacciones a deachwita de agust d (integrante de bts suga) Y si quieres escuchar algo de la vocal line, te recomiendo The truth Untold, o reacciones a Mokrosomos, Pied piper, fake love, magic shop, Lie de Jimin, Stigma de V(taehyung), my time de Jungkook, trivia just dance de J hope.. Dionysus de todos, SEA.. Jajajajaja perdón por tantos, pero se que te van a gustar.. Por cierto, cantas muy hermoso y tocas excelente"
"Amo tus reacciones  tenés que reaccionar a ""blue & grey"" es de su último álbum"
"Eso es lo que mas me encanta de mis bellos ángeles... BTS no tiene limites, hacen todo tipo de estilos, ojala los reaccionaras mas seguido asi podrias ir eacuchando mas de ellos, te aseguro que terminaras amandolos porque son puro ARTE, no solo sus estilos, sino que voces, letras, bailes, puesta en escenas, videos, conciertos  etc etc etc todos te cuentan una historia, todos tienen un transfondo y ademas se relacionan entre ellas y son inmensamente variados... Unicos!!! Esta cancion LIFE GOES ON es una canción para Army de esperanza, que a sido crucial en este tiempo de crisis, encierro y enfermedad para todos... Que habla de como de un momento a otro el tiempo se congelo, los minutos avanzaban pero no nuestras vidas, pero que pronto llegará la primavera y con ella volveremos a reencontrarnos, es hermosa como un abrazo cálido, una dulce melodia con sus 7 voces conjugadas para mecernos en tiempos de dificultad. Ojala luego reacciones a otros temas, como ON, dionysus, fire, mic drop, Black swan (fliparas) idol, singularity,  blood sweat & tears (OTRA JOYITA) serendipity, fake love... Ufff y muchas mas!!!! SALUDOS DESDE CHILE 😘😘😘😘"
ME ENCANTÓ FEDE GRACIAS!!!! NO ME RINDO HASTA QUE REACCIONES Y ANALICES BLUE & GRAY💜
"El 90% de army mazacramos  las canciones porque no sabemos coreano😂 No te agobies, yo creo que nadie puede criticarte por eso💜💖 Excelente reacción💜💖"
Bueno como verdadera Army💜 a esperar a tu reacción 🙋🏻‍♀️🇲🇽
"Mas análisis de BTS, hay um mundo de músicas por analisar de los chicos.....army presente"
La canción tiene los subtítulos en español para que entiendas la letra que es muy emotiva
"""La música de estos chicos pasa por todos los estilos"" Es kpop, qué quieres que te diga  👁️👄👁️✨"
"Bts = variedad, nunca esperes el mismo ritmo."
Qué grande!  Amé tu análisis! Tienes que escuchar Blue & Grey!!
La canción tiene subtitulos en español....
"Bendiciones, tu canal seguirá creciendo , saludos desde Cuba 💜. Armys se están acercando los premios Grammy y hay metas para dynamite antes de la fecha ."
"Me da mucha ternurita cuando nos pide disculpas porque cree que va destrozar la canción, sabe de nuestra toxicidad😔....Si él supiera la de demonios que invocamos sin saber coreano😂😂😂😂"
"BTS es uno de los artistas más versátiles que podrás ver, desde baladas hasta trap y hip-hop. Son multitalentosos.  El vídeo oficial tiene subs en español :)"
"Me encantan todos tus reacciones y análisis , si queres saber que dicen las canciones , fíjate que suelen tener subtítulos , casi todas en inglés y algunas en español tambien, la letra de life goes on es bellísima tiene relación con la situación actual de la pandemia , en el mv oficial es super emotivo 💜 saludos y ojalá hagas más análisis de ellos,  algunas canciones fake love , blood sweat & tears , idol"
"ESTA CANCIÓN ES COMO UNA MEDICINA PARA ALIVIAR, POR TODO LO QUE PASÓ EL 2020."
"Algo que destacó siempre de BTS es que jamás se quedan en un solo género, a pesar de debutar como un grupo hip hop. Una cajita de sorpresa son.   Dato curioso:  Ellos hicieron completamente el álbum de la canción  (BE). Desde la producción del MV, canciones, letras de las canciones, hasta en el diseño del álbum estuvieron metidos. Otra cosa que destacó con orgullo de ellos es que hacen su propia música y sus canciones tienen un gran contenido."
10 dias? Desde acá veo que tienes odio en tu corazón😪 No tienes piedad
"Hola !!! Buenasss , bien para empezar (7:53) el de los falcetes es ""Jimin"" y el es de la vocal Line , otra punto es que cantas e interpretado la canción re bonito .   Sigamosss crack , por último te recomiendo ""Telephaty""  de ese mismo álbum llamado -BE-  y pues baisss , saludos!!!"
"Esperare los 10 días, es que necesito ver esto !!!"
"Habrás visto que casi todos te recomiendan blue and gray, pues yo también jaja, tu destino es verla y cantarla porque sé que te vá a gustar."
Y yo pensando que se estrenó y era para el 2 de enero 🤡 me emocione al pedo pero voy a esperar :D
"Reacciona a fake love tambien,saludos!"
"Me encantaría reacciones a Filter de Jimin es algo extraordinario, el tiene una voz hermosa y es muy carismático!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"Lol que bueno que apenas descubrí tu canal, así solo espero 13 horas 💀🤚🏻 Me gustan tus reacciones."
"En el min 5:00 el que la está haciendo de “arriba” es V el integrante con la voz más gruesa de todos en el canto, y el de “abajo” es JIMIN  el está haciendo la parte de la voz más aguda junto con el integrande JIN en cuestión de agudez con un pequeño coro de JUNG KOOK. Saludos!!!!"
"Esta canción es más íntima y habla que la vida sigue apresar de los problemas que se enfrentan,  ellos la escribieron por la circunstancias que estamos pasando, para animar a todas sus ARMYS"
Sabes que está ahora la opción de ver los vídeos de BTS  subtitulados al español? xD Al fin L army puede entender las canciones.
porfa reacciona a “Blue & Grey” es hermosaa :3
"Merece más apoyo del que tiene, tus reacciones son jodidamente lindas y a army le gustan, tus covers son arte ♥️"
El del primer rap es Rm El segundo rap Suga  Tercer rap J-hope Súper versátiles y talentosos
"Linda reacción! :)  Blue & Grey es un temón de su último álbum. En principio lo escribió y compuso Tae, pero al resto del grupo le copó la idea de sumarlo al álbum. Es una obra de arte inmensa"
La voz de Jimin... Inconfundible jajaja
Jajaja siempre te disculpas por como tratasbde cantar en coreano si nos escucharas a nosotras imaginate yo wachacheo horrible pero con sentimiento 😂😂😂
El falsete son los agudazos de Jimin <3
Soy Army mom...la primera vez que escuche esta canción.. me enamoró..es dulce ..es tierna..un mensaje precioso..y ademas interpretada por ellos..Amo BTS..❤❤💜
"Airplane pt2 de BTS es un temazo ;) Oh y por dios! Cantas precioso, ame el final uwu"
La voz de jimin es la más aguda 🥺🥺🥺
"Tienes que reaccionar a ""blue and gray"" de su último álbum es genial 💜💜"
RAP LINE:: SUGA..JHOPE..RM....    VOCAL LINE:: JIMIN..V..JIN..JK
Creo que después de todas las cosas que han pasado en el 2020 por el covid el álbum BE es lo mejor de ese año LIFE GOES ON me trajo una tranquilidad hermosa a mi me afectó mucho la cuarentena tenía depresión pero gracias a BTS lo pude superar  Una nueva suscriptora 😊
"AHORA TENES QUE REACCIONAR A BLUE AND GREY, TE JURO QUE ES HERMOSA Y MUY TRANQUILA. TE VAS A SORPRENDER DE LAS VOCALES"
Canción 1 en billboard hot 100 ( en coreano)
"Por favor reacciona a Your eyes tell, ON, Mac Drop, lights y black swan, son canciones que nos encantan al fandom de ARMY😭"
BTS tiene de todos los géneros y army no necesita saber coreano solo necesita saber la pronunciación en fácil 😎✌ me encantan tus reacciones. 💜🇰🇷✨ armys no creen que tenemos a un army boy en proceso?
yo dejando que cante las partes en ingles y yo cantando el coreano :v CANTAS HERMOSOOOO
Es un mensaje para la sociedad en esta cuarentena 😔👊🏻 “No importa lo q pase la vida continúa”❤️
"Jimin es el que hace esas notas tan agudas, en este último disco cada integrantes  hizo un tema y son bien interesantes,  hicieron un programa para la MTV este 23de febrero y subieron 2 presentaciones nuevas de este último disco, una es Telepathy y la otra es blue&grey son muy diferentes te vas a sorprender"
"No se porque pero me tiene anonadada como reaccionas, detallas cada cosa👌🏻 amo más aun cuando reaccionas de BTS 💜 Y Amo totalmente tu voz 💥 En serio no me arrepiento de haber pasado por tu canal 👌🏻💜"
"Aparte de los bailes, la versatilidad musical, etc de BTS ellos también componen y producen su propia música, además de que si te fijas en las letras como la de esta canción LIFE GOES ON te sorprendes realmente."
Es que Jimin así de aguda tiene su voz
Esta cancion se debe al covid!! Habla de la pandemia. Lo escribió  V.. y el video está a cargo de Junkook
"Esta canción nos da esperanzas, después de todo lo q pasamos por la pandemia........"
Reacciona a on kinetic manifesto film por favor 💜💜
"Me encanto la parte en que reconoció a Jungkook 😅💜 que linda reacción y lo mejor al final hasta me dieron ganas de aprender a tocar guitarra, podrías hacer un video enseñando que guitarra es buena y como empezar? Sería genial 🙌🏼✨"
"Un observador con conocimiento musical.  Interesante la movida K pop en el mundo, de la que BTS es un excelente representante. Muchos recursos de diferentes generaciones. Una super produccion detras y obvio estos niños maravillosos, humildes y disciplinados. Por como van....ya son una leyenda. FEDE sigo tu trabajo musical y tus videos .  👍saludos desde Neuquen!"
Analiza SPRING DAY o mejor dicho todo el album ''wings'' y ''you never wak alone'' tremendas canciones salen de ahó
Yo creo que el bias de de Fede es Namjoom! JAJAJA se nota♡
"Sí es Junkoo y Jimin los que hacen los dos falsetes, como dices!  Poco a poco irás sabiendo quien es quién!!"
"Hola soy nueva ame tus reacciones, quisiera que reacciones a Dimash Kudaibergen es un cantante kazajo su musica es estilo clásico y pop entre otros. Su voz es única tanto que creerás que es mentira, pero te aseguro que es real por favor reacciona con la canción S.O.S gracias! 😘  y amo también BTS"
"DE VERDAD QUE ERES TALENTOSO PARA LA MÚSICA!!! Yo no puedo reconocer las notas solo con escucharlas así como tú, felicidades!!! Y bueno, que escuches a BTS es genial, jejeje"
"Creo q el q sube el estrebillo es Jimin y los otros chicos lo bajan pa q se escuche saludos desde Honduras, nueva suscriptora"
Quiero ver cómo explota tu mente reaccionando a Dionysus 💕
"Ponle subtitulos, las letras de sus canciones son muy bonitas 😭😭🙏🙏"
02:47 life goes on tiene subtítulo en español :>
Fede en serio no encuentro a alguien que analice y reaccione a las canciones como tú los haces. Lo haces rebién 😀👏🎊
"Siempre le atinas a JungKook!!!   Fede, aca tenes muchísimas canciones para entretener a ARMY latam, la discografía de BTS  es extensa desde sus inicios y aseguro que vas a tener miles de vistas!  Pasaré link a mis amig@s ARMY para que te piten, gracias por reaccionar a los chicos."
Por fin llego tu analisis!! Estaba con muchas ansias esperandolo!!! Me encanta tu analisis si me hubiera gustado mucho tambien que veas la letra ya que habla de la situacion actual y es una cancion dedicada a sus fans. Te recomiendo de su nuevo album blue and grey te va a encantar y es ideal para que hagas un cover completo tienes una voz hermosa!! Te dejo el link ya q no tiene mv saludos desde argentina!!! https://youtu.be/pFNkMGrfdc8

“You need to feel the cold to understand the warmth” -  Jeon Jungkook
Send him  anywhere and at the end JK will be talking about RM only.
Popular opinion : Everyone agrees that JUNGKOOK is a king.
"Who's bias here is Junkook??🤔  I just want to know ,👇👇"
Everyone appreciate that Bighit didn't blur the tattoo
"he keeps calling namjoon ""rapmon hyung"" 🥺"
Wise words from a wise man “You need to feel cold to understand the warmth”  This is Jeon jungkook everyone
Popular opinion: Every ARMY is happy because Min Yoongi is back.
"Actor of the year ""Jeon Jungkook"""
He is hardworking and dedicated
"Instead of just saying he is cute, hot, handsome..... can we all appreciate the fact that he worked so hard for the 'ON' mv Go stream it!"
Anyone after jungkook's blond hair 🤩🤩
"JUNGKOOK no está tratando de ser guapo, guapo está tratando de ser JUNGKOOK."
"realmente aprecio mucho el trabajo de los chicos, aquí podemos ver que kook tenía mucho frío y aún así se metió al agua, otra cosa es lo que traía en las manos, no se si sean de verdad las espinas pero si los son se imaginan como le duele? deberían agradecer su esfuerzo y reconocerlo en vez de comentar cosas sin sentido 💜💜💜💜💜✨"
He's so cute🐰
Those scenes he filmed were actually one of the most impactful of the final video so he should be (and the filming crew) proud.
1:01 all the people around laughing at koo's cute facial expression that's so heartwarming 🥺
"How Many İNTERNATİONAL ARMY FANS Are Here  ""Jungkook"" 👇👇"
i'm an Exo-l but i came to watch this video  to see JK's tatto and his pretty face 😅
The staff: Let's do the running scene one more- Jungkook: 😑
"Jk the cutest, kindest , loveliest, multi-talented Golden maknae ❤️."

He is soo cute He is looking soo handsome and cool with those tattos on his hands
Camera man: Focuses on Jk removing his shoes Armys: Time to see jk's tattoos free
"Koo is such a talented person, it's impossible not to be proud of him. He is so professional and dedicated to his work, I admire him so much. Jungkook I love you"
Jungkook it's perfect
For anyone asking Jungkook got injured by the thorns. That isn't makeup. Poor Kookie hands!!
Popular opinion: Every ARMY is happy because Min Yoongi is back.
Ok let's talk about how the staff didn't EVEN blurred Jungkook's tattoos.
Missing you Jungkookie
Jk: *shook that his gonna be in the water in a cold weather*  Jk: THE SUN 🌞 IS TOO BRIGHT  Jk : it's so cold :<  Me: wait wha-
"JUNGKOOK is not trying to be Handsome, Handsome istrying to be JUNGOOK"
But he really can end the careers of all the actors.
He looks so much like Yoongi at 1:28 !

"He went to the ambulance immediately, because he was in a state of stroke in the brain. I saw the video on another channel."
"잘생긴 미친 미모, 사슴같이 큰 눈, 투명한 피부, 빨간 입술, 천상의 목소리, 쩌는 가창력 어찌 너를 사랑하지 않을수 있을까..."
Jungkook trabalhando duro
"Jungkook es una persona de ejemplo a seguir, JK gracias por todo tu esfuerzo..."
2:29 que chingaos debo estudiar para ponerle una toalla a Jungkook :v
I am poor from money but I am rich from my heart for You dear Jungkook. I promise you one day we will meet.. Love you so much my dear life
"“You need to feel the cold, to understand the warm” - Jungkook 2020   That was actually really beautiful and I want to get it as a tattoo 😁😁💜"
Jungkook neden adamı deli edecek bir tatlılığın var ❤️
Sigo pensando como puede existir un hombre tan bello en este mundo
Only army's are gonna read this others would skip            KOOKIE SMILE IS EVERYTHING
"agora vejam o quanto eles se oferecem para nós dar os conteudo... aaaa kook deve ter sentido muito frio, meu bebzinho army ama muito jk~ he is jkeyyyyyyyyy queria ser staff só pra cuidar deles!"
Lesson of the day:  “You need to feel the cold to understand the warm” - JK
No-one:    Littlerely no-one:   Not even Jin's windshield wiper laugh:       Me: *Replays Jungkook saying 'Rap mon' a million times*
"Ahhh mi JK pobresito!! T T se lastimó sus manitas con las espinas y se murio de frio!! Todo por darnos un buen MV para ON ahhh no lo merecemos, gran trabajo Jungkook. :*"
I feel bad that jk went in cold water for us
Oh the way that guy said “action jk!” At jungkookie at 0:18🥺🤧
"“YOU NEED TO FEEL THE COLD, TO UNDERSTAND THE WARM” - JUNGKOOK 2020"

we stan a hardworking king
Jungkook is beautiful 💕🍃
Hoping for Jungkook that he will try acting/an actor in kdrama
Why is no one talking about those tattoos... they're so freaking cool.
"Even in his coldness, JK still thinks about Namjoon <3"
Me:think the cuts are real on his arm  Jungkook :chilling
"Eita, eles trabalham pra porr@ e merecem sim toooodo o sucesso que fazem!!!!😳💜 Edit : ainda mais no frio!!"
Let us have mercy on the spirit of Kook Stan 🗿🖤.
Happy New Year everyone 😀 2021🎄 Всех с Новым годом 😀 2021

"Im an army but shows should stop naming TXT as ""BTS younger brother"" it doesnt feels right. It is not right."
Kbs was plain disrespectful this time. To hurt the kids like that. To hurt txt. To simply use bts for clout.
"Moa, we always tell each other, “Stairs not elevators,” but KBS disrespecting TXT feels like we are being thrown down the stairs."
Before most of k media ignore BTS and now they are literally selling their name lmao😂they even put BTS in thumbnail..please don't do this to TXT..kbs you ar so rude👎
아 진짜 이건 윌벤영상인데 뭐 방탄이랑txt 에대해 싸우고 그러나..
The fact they are still named TXT as “BTS younger brothers” instead of introduce TXT themselves. I HATE KBS😭😭
Estoy cansada de que no reconozcan a txt por su talento  utilizaron a los tres 1- utilizaron a bts para más audiencia 2- engañaron alos niños  3-presentaron a txt como bts junior Es enserio lo que hacen se imáginan el momento incómodo que sintieron???? Soy ARMY pero deberían dejar de trata a txt así ... comparándolos con BTS eso no es justo
"KBS les mintio a unos nenes diciendo q iban a conocer a BTS pero llevaron a TXT y los usaron a los dos grupos, eso no se hace y yo no me voy a quedar callada xd"
벤 똑부지러지게 말 잘한다
I hope our MOAs don't hate BTS because of KBS's deeds. We ARMYs respect and love TXT.
People would  have watched even if you guys had told it was txt . I like both txt and bts !!!!
"아 근데 트바투분들 앞에서 방탄분들만 찾으면 투바투분들 입장에선 살짝 서운할 수도 있긴하겠다,, 이건 애기들 잘못이라기 보다는 좋아하는 그룹이 아닌 가족 그룹을 소개시켜준 피디 잘못도 살짝은 있지 않을까,,,"
저 의상은 어디서 산거야ㅋㅋㅋ귀여워♡
피디 삼촌에게 TXT형아들 따라 소속사 안에 들어간다고 손 흔들면서 자랑하는게 왜 이리 귀엽냐ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Perfect performance
"i hate kbs, there’s literally so many things that are wrong with this video. first of all the children were told they’d meet bts but txt arrived instead. txt were introduced as bts younger brothers and they aren’t even included in the title. plus when they came in they kept playing boy with luv, is it so hard to play one of their songs. man this is so disappointing"
알엠 파트 자리로 가있는거 넘 귀여움ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
"this show needs to make it up to them. they falsely advertised as if BTS was the one showing up and made TXT show up instead as if they’re option #2. it’s disrespectful to the groups, fans, and the kids."
"Kbs does not deserve Soobin as MC, he deserves something better, something that treats him correctly and I did not cover them with the name of another group"
우리 벤..태태가 최에구나...💜 와 윌벤저스 성덕..
This was so sad.. in a annoying and disappointing way! I felt bad for the kids cuz they wanted to meet bts but they gave them txt instead! Also as a moa.. this was upsetting seeing them only mention bts! They should’ve showed the kids a txt song like cat & dog so they would be excited to see txt and not just mention bts all the time.. ugh this was so bad
2:53 픽쳐~ 시퍼~ 너무 귀여어
AS a MOARMY I FELT SAD FOR TXT GETTING DISRESPECTED
사랑스런 아가 벤틀리 😍
슈돌에서 느끼는게 역시 연예인 아들 딸들은 부럽다...
okay but let's face it...kbs did wilben dirty telling them they'd meet bts....they had their hopes up 😢
I really hope they get to meet BTS their faces when they didn’t meet them made me sad🥺🥺🥺🥺
벤틀리가 형아들 앞장서서 가고 대장이네❣
txt has gone through hard times and is always humiliated don't make them hurt more. We are sad Moa
Them talking about TXT being called 'BTS Younger Brothers.'  Meanwhile me: doesn't understand anything.😀
"This is absolutely disrespectful and as a MOA, annoying. Stop naming BTS in everything TXT does. KBS did not only disrespect my five boys but also BTS and those two little kids. Y’all made it so embarrassing. Stop using BTS name when naming TXT, they are both separated groups. ANNOYING AF"
우왕 윌벤 귀욤💜💜
아 너무 구ㅏ엽따... 보는 내내 웃음밖에 안 나옴... 🙃 입꼬리 귀에 대롱대롱 걸고 다닐 판
울벤🐥 쿨하게 나갔다하고 가는거봐 진챠 귀여워😭❤
"ㄴ,, 나도... 귀여워 얘들아..."
Big Hit revealing their quarters because they'll be moving soon 😂😂😂
방탄 나올것처럼 노래 계속 틀고 하더니 나오지도 않고 툽애기들 나와서 연습실 구경시켜주고 회사라운지 소개시켜주고 투바투 한테는 뉘신지?자막이나 달고 끝까지 방탄은 안나오는데 영상 제목은  BTS의 피땀눈물을 느끼다ㅋㅋㅋ
"Espero y en un futuro bangtan el original pueda conocer a los nenes, ya que ellos son fans de BTS y no de TXT, tremendo lo que hizo KBS al poner a txt.  Como¿por qué? Para darles un recorrido? Esto parece como ""no tenemos a tus ídolos pero, si a quienes son de la misma empresa, y los han conocido. ¡Ya está!""😑  Al menos pongan alguna canción de txt"
Yo al ver que los niños tienen mas suerte que yo al conocer a txt f por mi
"Nunca pensé que odiaria a otra empresa que no sea Bighit pero aquí vamos de nuevo, te odio KBS"
"yo KBS you're kinda mean?? you just scammed the kids basically? also introduce TXT as TXT, not BTS juniors. do better"
"As a Moa, this is really disheartening. Moa and TXT are constantly disregarded, “TXT is privileged,” “All Moas are Armys.” We always tell each other “stairs not elevators,” but having KBS disrespect TXT feels like we are being thrown down the stairs."
DIOOOS TXT son amores de personas y la gente lo debe reconocer por SU TRABAJO Y ESFUERZO ellos son realmente impresionantes en todos los aspectos que mala parte de KBS el hacer eso
난 둘애기만 보고 채널휙.. 아가들 형아들 처럼 잘자라렴💕💕💕💕
투바투라도 출연 시켜줘서 고맙습니다.
"i honestly hate what kbs did, they use the kids, txt, and bts for clout, for views. I also feel so bad for these kids they really love to see bts. And im so sad for txt, i know they're under bh but this clout users always mentioning bts when it comes to txt, txt has there own name and that is not ""bts younger brother"". I really hate this industry.  ps. sorry for bad english, english isn't my first language so sorry.  pps. im not blaming bts or txt or the kids, what im blaming here is kbs it's their fault."
귀여워 주금
그냥 혹시나 하는 맘에 갔다가 다들 대박 당황했을것 같다 ㅎㅎㅎ 애들이 투바투 덕분에 여기저기 둘러보고서 진짜 좋은 구경하고 돌아갔을것 같아서 넘 다행이다 ㅎㅎㅎ
"Su nombre es✨ TOMORROW X  TOGETHER✨, no los hermanitos de BTS.   His name is ✨TOMORROW X TOGETHER✨, not BTS's little brothers."
저 아가가 나보다 훨씬 성공했다... 나는 태어나서 연습실 문턱도 단 한번도 못 가봤는데ㅠㅠㅠ 윌리엄 이 사랑스러운 아가야 진심 너가 짱이다!!!!^^  앞으로도 방탄소년단 형아들 많이 사랑해줘~~~^^ 그리고 TXT 형아들도 많이 사랑해줘~~~~^^
shows should stop using bts for clout and stop saying they are bts' brothers or dongsaeng what they called. like its so disrespectful both for bts and txt. it just shows that txt are shadowbanned by bts popularity. this needs to stop
아니 한국어 댓이 왜 이렇게 없어..화날라 하네
이거보구 연준님한테 입덕.......애기들을 저렇게 좋아해쥬다니ㅠㅠㅠ
Every thing apart... These kids dancing on Boy with love was tooo cute to handle.  The one who is RM's fan going side cause it's not his part was.. Just too adorable 💜🤍
"""I Can't understand what people are sayin""🤧😂"
"Am disappointed that my precious boys TXT are being sideline again, they're not even mentioned in the title, not even in hangul. They should stop introducing TXT as BTS little brothers. Why won't they let TXT shine. People would be blind if they do not see the potential and abilities TXT have. Even during the weverse NYE concert, TXT performance is so far the best. Their solo dances and yeonjun killing all the dance breaks he's in. Im so proud.   Also please show love for TXT, they have their own variety show called TO DO and its released every monday on their Vlive channel. Its nice to see our precious boys having fun. The 1 year anniversary of their TO DO show is on 13th January. MOA fighting!"
근데 울아가들 저거 손소독제하구 로션 잘발라야할텐데ㅜㅜ안그럼 손 따가워지는뎅ㅜㅜ아가들 로션 잘바르고 아프지마요~
윌벤 귀여워ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Felt bad for these cute kids..too early for disappointments..hoping they'll be able to meet BTS soon..  Salute to TXT for cheering up the kiddos and saving the day!!!🦸‍♂️🦸‍♂️
윌벤 귀여워ㅠ
"the fact they don't even mentioning txt even once in the titles, so disrespectful"
아 너무 귀여워 어카지 웰벤져슼ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
they are tomorrow x together. TOMORROW X TOGETHER!! bish y'all didn't even put their name for the title
연예인 앞에서 춤 춘다는게 어디야?  이미 성공한 인생이다 우리 윌벤저스^^
I love how william knew when to come in. He's  definitely been watching all their performances.
These boys are huge fans of BTS. It was dirty to promise that they’ll meet them without knowing that for sure. And my babies TXT had to entertain them by talking about BTS
TXT was resting so well today because of their performances during Blue Hour era that they didn't know they're going to show up while Bangtan was busy on their schedule. I'm stuck between anger & happiness because I'm OT12 stan. I blame you KBS for this!!
"ㄴㄴ,,, 나도.. 손 잡ㅇ아줘.."
"i honestly feel so bad for yeonwoo bc he love to dance the most,he also wanted to be an idol.Ofc I'm happy for willben but it would be so much fun if they include yeonwoo too<33"
I'm an army and i'm so proud to see this two little guys who I also adores loving my most treasured kpop group💜💜 borahae william and bentley
"YEONJUN’s close interaction w/ the kids rly highlighted his hyung role in TXT and HUENINGKAI being the maknae that he is, must have known what those kids wanted, so since they cant meet bts, he immediately suggested to place the artworks on whiteboard for BTS to easily see them"
"How are KBS doing this when they have Soobin as an MC, it makes no sense to be disrespectful to someone who is literally working on your own show."
"I really wish BTS takes some time from there busy schedule for them. I can imagine V will be like ""I am  taking this kid me forever """
"People are talking about respectful and all,  I just love how my TXT is enjoying in this video 😘 whether they're referred as BTS brother or belittled,  but we all know how talented and amazing they are. I love you TXT, you came all the way here because of your talent. I love how they are interacting with William and Bentley 💘 so much of love TXT"
"If Taehyung met them, he would be very excited, I guess. He likes kids."
"This is so disrespectful to TXT! To say that BTS would come and put them as ""Brother of BTS"" just to attract viewers is disappointing. In addition to also deceiving children by making them think that would see BTS. But I am proud of my boys, even going through this >> big disrespect << they interact well with the children and had fun with them."
Please give TXT the recognition they deserve.
아 진짜 개부럽다.. 나도 연습실이라도 가보고싶다
"txt were so nice to the kids and the kids were so adorable too, this wholesome content 🤧🤧🤧"
"KBS remembers that TXT is an idol not a tour guide, please, TXT also has a heart, maybe in front of the camera they have fun, but who knows what they feel, txt deserve better"
"his name is TOMORROW X TOGETHER not the ""bts brothers"""
"THEY ARE TXT, KBS YOU ARE SO INHUMAN DO YOU KNOW THE DAMAGE YOU CAN CAUSE TO MY CHILDREN ??TXT DESERVES TO BE KNOWN BY NAME NOT UNDER THE NAME OF ""BTS'S BROTHERS"""
"This is so disappointing.I feel bad for the kids,Kbs literally scammed them.The kids wanted to meet bts so bad but instead they gave TXT plus TXT has their own name and their name is should be known for what it is,Not Bts younger brothers.Their name isn't even mentioned in the video even in hangeul."
TXT will shine on their own. Just wait and see! ❤️
Aside with the very obvious issue I’m glad TXT got to meet the babies I’m sure they had a great time despite being deceived.
KBS is being derespectfl to txt they kept playing bts song even though txt is the one who entertaint them? I mean its really uncomfortable saying bts is there while its txt  Im Moa and Im dissapointed because kbs didnt recognizes the existing of TXT pls be respctful to txt i live this group and dont link txt and bts. And pls play there music thats why i dont like thiss.hays
Omg this is so cute I can’t take this anymore 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍✨🎵
I love how Ben is always so approachable with strangers. Baby Ben is the best!!!
"TXT is already 2 years on their career, they should introduce them as *TOMORROW X TOGETHER*"
At 0:25 Just look at how Will-Ben looking tiny infront of Giant TXT esp. Leader Soobin & Bentley that is so adorable😻😸. Will-Ben and TXT were so cute😍.
They just do it for popularity...Like KBS is so selfish...atleast they wouldnt have played with kids heart...and saying txt as bts siblings is still getiing out of nerves
"Aigoo.. Thanks willben, we got the trip.. Hope they can face v and rm face to face"
"I feel bad for the kids and txt. Kbs don’t promise anything if you can’t do it smh and pls stop referring txt as bts little brothers just how many times are we gonna say that for y’all to finally stop, it’s not that hard."
"Damm, and here I thought we were finally getting away from the whole ""BTS's younger brother"" label. TXT is their *own* group, and it's about time they be treated as such"
"Don't worry moas....some toxic fans are taking advantage of this and saying that txt is bad, but honestly don't worry. We'll see what haters gonna say when txt will dominate the world. Fighting!"
I really feel bad for the kids and txt coz I KNOW they really want to meet BTS its just like its disrepectful. Why dont they film it if BTS has free time right?
At least they should add TXT song..  Its so salt to see TXT treat that way..
"So many ARMY and MOA are agitated. But for me there is nothing wrong about anything in the video. First, ""BTS's younger brothers"" is used to refer the relationship of BTS and TXT off the stage. Remember that they are explaining this to kids. Also, being disappointed about a simple thing proves that you are not really supportive of your idol. ""Naming TXT as BTS's younger brothers"" you say?? You're just perceiving it like that. They were not named like that. People are just saying that TXT is in the same company with BTS.  Second, ""They should have played some TXT songs at least."" People, the kids do not know TXT, therefore they probably do not know their songs. Also, there is no appointment set, therefore it wasn't planned. It just happened that they met TXT. Third, ""They were not in the title and in the thumbnail"" you say. Guys, the kids were expecting BTS. They thought they could meet them. However, they met TXT instead. To dramatize the scene, editors will use BTS thumbnail so that the viewers will expect too. Also, this is all about ""to meet BTS"" and therefore the title suggests.  Guys, be matured enough. As an ARMY and MOA, I don't see any disrespect here. If we want a separate appreciation of TXT's interaction with the kids, file a petition to make them have visit to their house or have a mini fan meeting."
Everybody talking about txt I was thinking about this little guys are going to be an idols 😎😎
HEY!THIS IS TXT! TXT! TXT NOT BTS! GIVE A PROPER TITLE! RESPECT! EVEN THIS IS NOT BTS WE'RE STILL GONNA WATCH IT BECAUSE THIS IS TXT!!!!
だいぶカットしてますがオットケセンガッケとアジックドヨジョニはもっとしつこかったです😂😇w
マンネlineは元からうるさいって思ってたけど、これで確信しました。完全にヒョン達から学んだんだと
置いていかれるアミ一同
1:01 韓国のすずめ特殊な鳴き方してて草‪w‪w
5:47 このやりとり見てるとナムさんは弟だしジンニムは兄なんだなって改めて実感して尊さが増す、、、
バンタン1のインテリコンビのはずが、こんなIQ低めの放送になるとはw
友達同士でたまに変なツボ入って笑い止まらんくなる時あるよねwww
前半ちょいちょい出てきたユンギの肌が綺麗すぎて女子やめたくなった
唯一の大卒＋IQ.148＝そこらの騒がしい幼稚園
ここにジミンかユンギがいると、この2人の暴走止めてくれる(ユンギ途中で諦めそう)だろうし、キム三兄弟になるともっと会話が成り立たなくなりそうだし、ジョングクいたら作業に没頭してて聞いて無さそうだし、ホソクは最初から近づかなそう😂😂😂
ナムさん結構ガタイがいいはずなのに肩幅さんと一緒にいるから華奢に見えるマジックにかかった
ナムさんの釣りの断り方がアミを出すことによってこれ以上反論できないかつWWHな長男を上手く持ち上げてて、さすが世界のBTSのリーダー👏🏻
5:05 全細胞が君を求めてる ってなんかホラーなんだけどwww もはやバラードww
ナムジュン氏すっぴんイケメンすぎね？？？？
2人揃うと一家の大黒柱の様な安定感というか、安心感がある。
7:35ナム｢麺は大丈夫｣ジン｢麺は太らない｣ 私｢いやガッツリ炭水化物じゃん‪w‪w‪｣
10:32 普通の人だったら「あ、6時だ」って言うと思うけど笑いのセンスがある人は「夜ご飯の時間だ」ってなんか笑い取れる言い方できるよね
こうして2人の人が話してるだけなんだけど、なんで何回も見ちゃうの私。 なんでニヤニヤしちゃうの私。 でもさ、みんなそうよね、同じよね❤️
男同士でこういうくだらない話しかしないのは俺たちと変わらないんだなwwwwwwww
5:01 DNA  6:15 認める涙
あまりにも素が出てるって、どんだけ平和なのよ。こんな、長男とリーダーに見守られて、そりゃあ、あんなに可愛いマンネ達が育つわけだ。
これ見ると更にBTSメンバーみんな好きになっちゃう。本当ジンもナムジュンも楽しい 最後のオチがいいね。 夕食時間だったつぅ~笑
この人達今でも「どうやって」とか「認める」とか「今でも」を言う度に思い出してはツボってんのかな....................
頭がいい2人なのに会話がの中身がすっからかんすぎて超面白いし超可愛い😂😂🥺
弟に自分スクラッチアートを自然災害って言われてるのに歌にしてしまう心の広さと陽気さが好き笑 可愛いしおもしろい笑
8:21 んーんー！なむさんかわい
ツッコミ不在すぎて、armyが画面に向かってツッコむことになる現象
8:30ここで なんかわからんけど 笑いつられた方いません？ww
このVLIVE好きすぎるwwww 長男＆リーダーの組み合わせ…… ちゃんとしてるはずなのに！w
この動画を皮切りにBTS見る手が止まらないのでどうにかして欲しい🥲
地味にこのブイラ、神回
DNAの没のサビもう覚えてしまったwww
ほんっっとにこの回とこの2人が好きすぎてwww 主様の編集のおかげで面白さに拍車かかった気がしますwww
好きすぎる2人😭⭐️ほんまにバンタンのジン母とナム父。画面が平和でしかない。主さんありがとうございます😭💜
ジンくん、この頃もしんどかったりしてたのかな? 素を出せるメンバー達がいて良かったなぁ〜
6:30 ナムリンの笑い方、癖強いなw
7:24いやソクジン肩幅よ爆笑爆笑爆笑
ナムさんが弟感出るの萌える
1:01 ジンくんの鳥の鳴き声にツボってここから進まない笑
袖で拭くのテテにやられてたよねwww
ユンギが居ないとこでユンギいじるの好きwww

ナムジュンの弟感がたまらなく可愛くてしんどい❣
ジンくんと居る時はしっかり弟なナム🥺
笑い方見てると小学生としか思えないけど肩幅があるおかげで現実に戻れたわw 編集ありがとうございます😭((((((((このお方たちは編集が大変だと思います笑笑
この回は何度見ても飽きないww
1番しっかりするべき2人が 1番狂ってしまった
5:00DNAが｢僕の全細胞が君を求めてるんだ｣じゃなくてほんとによかった…
ナムジンは最高なんだな😇 ボケとボケ同士でツッコミおらんから余計面白い笑笑
9:29 最速のフラグ回収wwwwww
8:30 つぼった2人につられ、訳もわからず笑いが止まらなくなる私。 ジンくんの口開けるの我慢してる感じが頭から離れない。腹筋割れる。
5:00 DNAこれじゃなくてよかった
リーダーと長男というお互いの重圧を分かり合える、一番楽で大事な関係なのかもしれないですね。二人が無邪気に笑ってる姿を見てるとなんだか安心します。
5:24 吹いたwwwwww
ジンヒョンの前ではラプモンさんも可愛い弟だね。無邪気なとこみると安心する
BTSの中ではしっかりしてる組なのにw面白すぎて1日3回は観てますw
7:52 ここから最後まで草すぎる🤣 BTSの吹き出しは全く汚く思えん！ 笑い泣きするジンニム可愛い💜 9:04 まじ急すぎて何？！って感じw 9:43 笑い泣きからの切り替えよw 10:18  フラグw

2021年M-1グランプリ最有力候補である 防弾少年団期待の星★ 【RJ】 の 「長編ボケ×ボケ漫才」を新年から観られて幸せです(?)
このV好きすぎて色んな人の編集見てるwwwwww
ジンニム嗚咽泣きの場面はよく見ていたのですが、こういう流れだったのですね〜！！  こんなにツボの浅い28才いますか？！高校生かっ！！ ジンニムとホソクさん（1番に笑ってくれる2人）の笑いは、周りを幸せにしますね❤️
平和過ぎる。ナムさん、ジンというるとリラックスしてるように見えて、さすがジンさん。
1:01 ヤバいツボwwwwww
細胞ver.で笑った
ラプモンが着てるTシャツ可愛すぎない？ボーダー効果なのかガタイのいいラプモンがすごく華奢に見える
このコンビは最高すぎる💜好きが溢れすぎて何度もリフレインしてしまう🤣最初から最後まで爆笑の嵐だったんだが‪w‪w‪w
もう〰ツボって、年明けから窓拭きしてます…多分、発狂に近いと(笑) ナムジン最強…これがバンタンの長男とリーダー🐹🐨笑笑
この2人と、1日一緒にいれるとしたら心が仏になりそう（？）
だいぶ中毒になってます。朝晩観ないと落ち着かなくなってる
ゆんの肌をずっと見てしまうのは私だけだろうか とても純粋なパールの様な肌
インジョンヌムルとかめっちゃ声れいだし最後の方のナムさんのインジョンが可愛すぎる！😍
ジンさんとナムさんの人の良さが滲み出てる。。！
ジンがテテみたいな事してるww
ジンくんの｢オットケ………‪w‪w‪w‪w‪w‪w‪w‪w｣で察する私
5:01 ~の 編集最高です😍😍 夫婦漫才最高ですね😍時々ユンギも見れて 幸せ💜
テテもジンの服で拭いてたよね笑
5:10 この下り好きww
夜ご飯の時間になったらご飯を食べるんだ、のフラグ回収早すぎさすが長男
ご近所の皆様、騒がしい我が家をお許しください。  一年分笑い倒してしまったかもしれません。 ありがとうございます。
JIN　って、本当におかしそうに笑うよね。　つられちゃう。　チルソンサイダーが出てきて大爆笑！！　いいねー、この二人。
完全に大学生の空きコマのノリそのものなんよ、、
何回も見てしまう...かわいい...
ナムさんの即興ハモリが上手すぎてビビるさすがｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
5:15 自然災害wwwwww
9:28 ナムジュンのカッスカスのインジョンがたまに聞きたくなるwwwwwww
armyさん達に怒られるかもやけど、推しのENHYPENが尊敬する方たちっていって聞いたからBTSの動画見始めてたんだけど、面白すぎて動画見る手が止まられません。 これは、笑い堪えられません。なのにパフォーマンスかっこいいとか最高すぎる。
どんなに世界的に有名になっても変わらないこの感じがとても好き☺️ 他のグループ見ても結局戻ってくると安心するhomeでありオアシス
BTSの皆さんはめちゃめちゃ面白いですね‪w‪wあとarmyさんのツッコミの仕方が冷静で面白いです‪w
この誰も突っ込む人がいなくて天然ボケがだんだんインフレ起こしていく感じ、最終的にツボに入りすぎて二人と一緒に泣くほど笑って死にそうになるんだけどわかる人いますか
3:27  本人がいないところでベタ褒めするの、砂糖すぎるじゃん…
やばい うぅううう〜からのやつが一生笑えるwwwwww
もうこれ何回みてるだろう、www 好きすぎるwこの会話といいw笑いといいwww
これナムさん最近のたりょらで着てた服やん💜 この日が初めて着た日やったんね🤣 バンタンって皆お気に入りの服とか 何年も大事に着続けるの好感もてる🥰
なんか微笑まし過ぎるこのコンビ大好き
日本語字幕ありがとう😊BTSも普通の人間なのですね😊
ナムさんの方がお兄さんにしか見えない…
BTSのことはほとんど何も知らないんだけどこういう字幕付き切り抜きが面白すぎて毎日見てしまうw 早く名前覚えなきゃw
これリアタイで見ててジンの蒸気！蒸気！が 好き！好き！に聞こえて自分の耳はもう末期なんだなと思うと同時にジンがナムさんに愛の告白をしたんかと思って軽くパニクったのを今思い出した

"William's new life crisis, can't draw a perfect heart for BTS  😂 😂"
윌리엄 방탄진짜 좋아하나보다ㅋㅋㅋ저게 저렇게까지 대성통곡할일이냐곸ㅋㅋㅋ귀여워ㅓㅜㅠㅠㅠ
🧔🏻 : 아빠 나이 몇살이야?  👦🏻 : (😭) 스물세살...? 샘 아버지 반응도 웃기고 윌리엄 멘트도 웃겨 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Lets run a campaign inviting these two in RUN BTS. It would be so amazing
*I hope my babies William and Bentley can meet BTS in real life at BIGHIT when they visit them bcus I don't want to see their disappointed faces and I know if BTS meet them they will adore them so much 😍 after all we knew that BTS love kids alot 💜*
1:21 S: how old are you? W: 6 yrs old 😭 S: do you know how old appa is?  W: (didn't know)... 23 yrs old????  S: hahaha what??? 😂 W: 24 yrs old???  S: LOL.. that's why I love you so much 😂🤣
이번 화 요약 윌리엄:ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 벤틀리:...??????????
2:55 벤틀리 우는 형아 옆에서 색연필 다 끌어안고 의기소침하게 가만~히 앉아 있는 모습 안쓰러우면서도 넘 귀엽고 사랑스러워.😘😘😘
벤틀리 윌리엄 우니까 아빠 부르고 조용히 앉아있는 게 많이 해본 솜씬데
누가 우리 윌렴 알엠횽아 만나게좀 해주세용 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
William is real army 😍😍
아이고 윌렴 랩몬 징짜 좋아하는구나. 하트가 아빠 처럼 안그려져서 속상해 울엉..그 마음이 넘 예쁘다. 그 와중에 벤틀리 우는 형아 아빠한테 ‘봐봐’ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ귀여워.
My baby is silent when William is crying. I don't understand what they are saying. But I feel sad to see him like that. He is always energetic kid but now.
Love how MOA & ARMY are knowing them now they're really so adorable babies
I loved how william wrote 'S' as jimin lol
Will’s passion for BTS. He really wants it to be perfect because he loves bangtan that much. My baby 🥺
우리 윌렴 알렘형아 얼마나 좋아하면 가지한테 뻥튀기 뺏길때처럼 원통해해ㅜㅠㅠ 그와중에 어른나이 최대치가 24살 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아직 애기야 애기😭
"3:02 엄지발가락이 휘어졌지만 느껴지지 않을 정도로, 벤도 사실 속으로 걱정😭❤"
"I'm sorry William.... I understand your frustration towards drawing the perfect heart but it's really funny, I can't help but laugh 😅😅😅"
벤 헝아 우니까 뭘잘못했는지도 모르고 미리 벌서고 있는게 안쓰러워~ 벤 이삐야 이삐~
2:45 the way Ben told Sam appa that Will crying but he know nothing about it 🤣
"William having a break down because he couldn't draw a perfect heart for Namjoon, yeah baby welcome to the fnadom 💜😂"
aww even i feel like crying with him aww...our baby ARMY
Wow! I hope BTS would meet TROS kids they're really adore them! And also whose narrating TROS? It's not Do kyungwan right?
"Did bently say to Sam ""look at him!"" ??? That's so funny🤣🤣🤣"
3:04 *Ben re-thinking all his life decisions*
윌리엄한테는 23살 24살이런게 많은거얔ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Ben is so adorable when he knocks the door 😂😍
i want to see them meeting the boys it would be so cute imagine how happy bts would be😭😭
RM should wacth this video. How william sad because he can't draw a heart for RM. So cuteee
"우주최강 초귀요미 벤, 그리기 좋아하는 창의적인 아가는 녕아랑 아부지랑 뭘하든 혼자 색연필도 챙기고 그림도 잘그려. 윌리엄녕아, 왜 저런대 무심하게 ""봐봐"" 하는 거 넘 웃겨! 시끄럽고 쓸데없는 설명소음 넘 듣기싫었는데 드뎌 바뀌었네! 지금처럼만 제발 슈돌 아가들 말할때 같이 겹치지말고 설명소음이 더 많거나 소리 더크게 하지마세요! 지금 딱 좋아요. 센스있는 하하씨, 찐웃음소리도 좋고 유진씨랑 꼭 필요한 타이밍에 멘트하시는 것도 바람직하네요!"
I really hope they can meet their idol soon. RM and V and BTS will be so thrill to meet them!!
"2:47 Bentley: 봐봐 👉🏻👉🏻  Ben was prolly like “Dad, look at him wtf idk 🤷” 😂😂😂😂😂"
Aw so cute when will cries while writing a letter 😂😂😂💜💜💜
2:48 ben so funny 😅😅🤣
윌리엄 울면 이모맴찢. 이모는 윌리엄바라기인데 ㅎ 내맘이 울애기맘이라.. 얼마나 속상할까. 이번주에 bts 만나는줄 알았는데 속상해 ㅠ 담엔 꼭 만나길 바랄께. 사랑해 아가들🥰😍🤩💗💕💖👍
I don't understand everything he say but I feel like crying too when I saw he's crying 😭
I heard Haha’s voice and squealed. Never expected it 😁
"Awe, William, your heart needn't be perfect, it is all the more beautiful because it isn't. BTS hyungs will still love it."
우리 120 하트 못그리고 편지 망쳤다고 속상한 저 순수한 마음 넘나 힐링인 것 또 다른 힐링파트는 녕아의 눈물에 눈이 더 똥그래진 토리💜
"The way Bentley said ""bwa bwa"" (look at hyung) is so hilarious"
Omge.. Why is the narrator new? Why? 🥺 I really like the old male mc's voice and laughter 🥺
아니 무슨 첫사랑한테 고백편지 쓰는 거 마냥 하트를 왜 그렇게 신중하게 그렼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 일리엄 진짜 와기야와기ㅜㅜㅜ
대성통곡하는 월리엄  무슨상황인지모르는 시크하고  억울한 벤틀리 둘다 귀여워 😁😁  😻😻
윌리엄 울지마😅알엠 형아가 얼마나 착한지아니? 아마 너의 편지 보면 너무 좋아서 어쩔줄 모를꺼야!!!나도 알엠 형아 제일좋아하는대😊너무나 사랑스러운 윌리엄~벤틀리~새해에는 보고싶은 알엠형아랑 V(태형 형아 꼭 만나고 건강하세요 알았죠?
When william cries because he can't draw a heart I felt sad too because it's me when BTS and other Kpop Idol release a new Album or lightstick. Lol!  But I find it cute because he really want to make something for BTS and he want it to be beautiful! I hope you can meet BTS soon💖
윌리엄 형아들한테 예쁘게 편지 써주고 싶은데 마음처럼 안되니까 우는모습... 웃으면 안되는데 귀여워서 자꾸 피식거리게 되네😂♥️  괜찮아 우리 윌리엄 형들은 윌리엄이 쓴 편지 고마워서 소중하게 간직할꺼야..!
They are the cutest army ever 💜
쿨하고 멋진 우리 벤틀리❤ 사랑해
벤틀리 ㅋㅋ 너무 웃겨서 이영상만 지금 50번째 재시청중 ㅋㅋ 윌벤 영상은 한번만 보믄 섭하다는 ㅋㅋ 업뎃 자주올라왔으면 좋겠는데ㅠ
"2:44 ""봐봐"" how is bentley so effortlessly funny"
Ohhmyghaaddd sorryy for laughingg Williiammm you're so cuteee babyyy
"i don't even understand bc no subtitle, but why I'm laugh so hard when there's ben just sitting and holding crayon while william crying 🤣🤣"
Aww William really loves Joonie so much. so cute
윌리엄이 남준오빠 준다고 하트그리는데 잘 안되서 겁나 서럽게 우는거 왤케 귀엽냐ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 나도 윌벤져스 보라해!! (티비 껐는데도 남준옵 ON 파트 가사까지 진짜 흡사하게 부른거 소름....)
"Sian didn't make it to see BTS , i hope William, Bentley or Yeonwoo be able to see them 🥺"
윌벤 왜이리 사랑스러운고야!!세상에서 제일 이뻐.착하고.사랑해~~~^^♥♥
"V would love to see this cause he mentioned them before, he likes watching them especially ben ""na ya"" one"
아 하트 못그리는거 너무너무 애기야 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
넘나 순수한 우리 윌벤이들... 💜
벤 바리바리 색연필 품고 다니는 거 뭐야 너무 귀엽잖아 ㅋ
RM덕후 윌리엄 ㅋㅋ  아미라서 더 웃김ㅎ
Aawwwww so adorable🥺💜
벤틀리랑 윌리엄이 너무귀여워서 진짜 너무귀엽다..
William you did so well♡. RM Hyung will love it
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ스물세살 스물네살ㅠㅠㅠ알엠형도 그것보다는 많이 먹었단다
The Most Adorable ARMY🤧 Love from BTS ARMY💜🤧💜
사랑스런 월리엄 효자일세. 샘=24살? 샘 부럽슴다.
읠리엄  ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아 너땜에 울다가 웃다가 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 너너무 귀여우다 💜💜💜
벤토리 숙연해진거 너무 귀엽잖아~~~~😍😍😍😍
But imagine if ENHYPEN met the kids 😭 and Jake and Sam have a little Aussie connection 🤭
우리 윌리엄 글씨도 쓰고 목소리도 말투도 진짜 많이 큰게 느껴진다ㅠㅠ글씨 더 잘쓰고싶어서 눈물까지 나는구나ㅠㅠ충분히 훌륭해 사랑해 우리 애기❤️
우리 윌렴 속상해쪄ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ토리는 미리 셀프 벌받넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ귀여워
벤틀리 어리둥절 하는거 귀여워♥
Cutie William and Bentley.🤗💜😇
아ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 형 우니까 아빠한테 일단 토스하고 셀프벌받는거 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 웃기네
I hope william&bentley will meet bts soon but im happy there's txt make them happyy
윌리엄 알렘형 꼭 만나게해주세요ㅜㅜㅠ
ㅋㅋㅋ 고뇌에 깊어진 팔자주름
"Every amis can relate to William, if BTS are involved we amis act like it's the end of the world/ we cried so easily.. Hahahaha... William your so cute..  He is really a fan.."
Aww the thumbnail 🥺
Awww William and Bentley are so freakin adorable😖😭😭💜💜💜
2배속의 노예인 내가 유일하게 1배속으로 보는 영상 중의 하나 윌벤져스♡
Fighting Will Ben ☺️💜
I hope they met BTS.. William loves RM so much everything what he do is for RM why he put so much  effort to make RM proud.. 😊 Aww your so cute..
스물셋살이래 앜ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
윌리엄 목소리가 이젠 완전 어린이가 됐구나...볼때마다 커가는게 참 내가 기분이 묘하네
어떠케 어떠케 윌리엄ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 벤틀리  진짜 웃긴다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅣㄱ😂😍
im so happy mah boys are now armys 🥺😍💜 borahaaaaaeeee 💜💜💜💜
진짜 ㅋㅋㅋ 우는것도 귀여워보이면 나 어터카징..??? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 😅
"Omg william is really an army. He put so much heart for writing the letter even he put so much effort to draw a heart, seeing him crying makes my heart hurt and what makes it hurt more is that he still can't meet them :((( I hope william and bentley can meet them soon 😭😭"
아고 ㅠㅠ 울 윌리엄이 BTS형아들 줄려고 아주 대성통곡을 해가면서 하트 하나 그린거야?아이구야 귀여웤ㅋㅋ
누가 윌리엄 RM 만나게해줘 귀여워ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅋㅋㅋㅋ
윌리엄 방탄 진짜 좋아하네 너무 귀여워

"BTS whole existence is *leJINdary* and *iconic* , haters gon hate but they just gon take over the world and the charts."
*BTS is funnier than every other comedian periodt* 😌💅🏻✨
"BTS AND ARMY's motto.... ""FOREVER WE ARE WILD.....FOREVER EVER EVER WE ARE WILD:"
4:25 V: My favourite animal is... Jimin: V V: 👁👄👁
Namjoon throwing his phone and Tae acting unbothered during there Grammy nom will forever be iconic
hobi “Eee” jungkookie “Aaay” jin “sports” LMFAOO THIS PART 😂😂
“Bts were wild in 2020”   When were they not? *never* 🙂
"When  Taehyung said ""Saxophonist"" Then Jhope laughed. I guess he remembered something of past which made me also laugh😂. If you guys know :)     Edit: Thank you so much for 610 likes💜"
"Guys, imagine BTS on ""When mom falls asleep"" Yoongi: unbothered Namjoon: destroying everything Jimin: constantly getting mad Taehyung: quiet, others sabotage so he can get punishments Hoseok, Jungkook and Seokjin: dying of laughter I know it's not gonna happen, but it would be so funny and interesting :("
They are the reason I smile everyday. I'm glad I'm staning such a talented and beautiful mess.
"But when the Jamais Vu team comes together, it’s a whole another world. Umm... let’s name the world something. (edit) I got their world name :- Janjankook World  So we basically have 4 worlds now :- BTS world, Army world, Hope world and Janjankook worl ;D"
1:07 Namjoon’s phone be like: *i guess I’m not wanted* 💀
"Bts:*gets nominated for grammys*  Tae:""THATS SUSPICIOUS.....DATS WEIRD-"""
"1:16 Tae knew that Bts was robbed, only being nominated in one category"
There's part of me that wants them to be just as wild in 2021 - entertainment at it's finest!
They seriously knew that ARMY'S were bored in quarantine
"Ladies and gentlemen and everyone in between, *I present to you the reason I wasn't bored in quarantine.*"
*I bet they were wild from the day they were born 😂😂*
Taehyung struggling to skate is literally just me walking 😂
"I absolutely DIED at the EA Sports bit, oh my god. Comedy kings."
3:48 Jungkook’s vocals. That’s all I gotta say. His vocals.
“Joon is a MOOD”  I have never seen anything more true 😂
"Jin is honestly every Army...  ""Ahh Jiiiin!!!"" ""I love this Jin!"" ""I'll never get tired of seeing this beautiful face"""
JIN proved he is an introvert when he said talking on the phone is scary. That is every introvert LOL
my friends : what’s your favourite animal?     me : a ‘brachiosaurus’
Your intro: s o  i c o n i c
Can BTS ever be this wild again???         Trust them... They're BTS
We need more of Jin-Jhope-Jungkook together
* *BTS getting Grammy nomination* * Taehyung: .......  * *BTS getting ramen cooker* * Taehyung:AAAAAHHHHSDXGHBDDHUJBJJG!!!!!
"Last time I was this early, Taehyung was at the alien planet."
I became ARMY in Stay Gold era and that was the best decision I've ever made
jk was trying to be inspirational and Jin just won’t let him be
4:16 this proofs that they share one braincell  Lmao I can't with the jinkookhope trio🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hobi: “You are letting the young ones learn bad things”  Me: Jungkook has always been bad 😏😏 But this time with Joons creepy laugh
BTS x Jimmy Fallon is chaos as we all know it 😅
I will always pray that they stay wild all the time and get even more wild😂😂😂

"BTS`s introduction in 2014: hello we are BTS BTS`s introduction in 2020: hey, hey, hey we are BTS.... boom, boom, phwe, phwe"
They are the only reason that my life changed... And we were able to survive this really toll taking year 💜💜💜
They saved my life not just 2020
"1:40  - I finally understood why he was talking abt rollercoasters now, makes so much sense"
The intro is just killing  Lob y💕a احبك💕  -lajibolala-
The swag is never too much..😭💜
Is it just me or was the 'BE' album review the same day they filmed the Dynamite dance practice? Lol.
the intro gets me all the time
"9:59-10:13 V representing ARMY, asking questions and hypotheses about the slightest thing (with BTS and BigHit you never know)"
Had the best year with BTS in 2020 💜
I love their chaos. Their fun energy heals my heart.
"Nobody: Namjoon: boom, disco, disco with tiny hand actions"
4:17      Jh: 𝗘𝗲𝗲  Jk: Aʏʏ   Jin: 𝓢𝓟𝓞𝓡𝓣𝓢     6:43   i died JIN FITS WITH EVERYTHING SO WELL
Now a days comedians are scared that they might get fired anytime coz bts are gonna take their jobs PERIODT
When v said saxophonist  Bts : what happened to sexyp*rnistar🤣🤣🤣
"BTS literally saved 2020, I don’t remember what I did this year but I remember every thing that happened to them😭"
who needs a dictionary when BTS is the definition of everything-
13:08 is me when my teacher gives me my test back.
RM: Jimin is our zebra!  Jk: JiMinBrA!!!!   😂😂😂😂😂😂💜😂😂😂😂😂

hobi: disco overload im into that jungkook: im good to go jin jungkook and hobi singing together: i'm- me: I'M DIAMOND YOU KNOW I GLOW UP CUS I-I-IM IN THE STARS TONIGHT
Jin saying being handsome is the best CANT RELATE BUT YES

"4:29  Namjoon- what is your favourite animal Kookie- my favourite animal is a ✨brachiosauras✨  So, let me get this stratight. He can pronounce the most complicated animal word but he cant say FrUsTrAtEd?   I- I don't have think-"
"Our unstoppable laughing tonic , come on crackheads....let's watch crackhead content starring our crackhead boys😂"
Janjankook is so iconic I can’t-
1:17 Taehyung was more happy receiving the ramen cooker than the Grammy's😂💜
Taehyung : Did we really get nominated? Is this really us?...huh I’m confused...is this a dream? I don’t believe this While the other three beside Tae : WOOOHOOOO IM LIVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE BRUH I DONT CARE WE GOT NOMINATED FOR GRAMMYS  RM: I DONT CARE ABT U PHONE....IM LIVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE...GO DIE   😂😂😂
BTS was amazing in 2020 and STILL IS-
17:02 yoongi saying LIAR just made my day 🥺
"the phone's mindvoice : he just threw me, i am the one who helps him thru his difficult times in kitchen! edit: jk puts his hand inside his shirt and i go like ""this ain't fair god"""
I love how Namjoon literally gave us a lesson on how to garden and kitchen countertops
"''I'm pig, oink, oink'' - Jin"
1:15  Taehyungs brain: so I’m fr abt to be surrounded by some more white ppl?? Damn that sucks

"At 3:47 after Jungkook sung that part Jin was like ""like and arrow..."" *ya I can't top that*"
6:48 Jin being shy to show his skin is so cute!
11:05  Joon exposing himself to reading fanfics:

"""Nghe nói làm leader của nhóm Bangtan vui lắm"" RM bất lực said"
"Cả một bầu trời cute hột me 😂 Đang nằm trong phòng, tắt hết đèn cười như hăm...😂 Sao đời này có những (7) con người cute thế chứ ?  Nghĩ hoài ...không ra tại sao ?"
"Cô Nở lại đánh úp mọi người tiếp 🤣 Nhưng may là một số bn Army h này vẫn chx off, bị đánh úp nhưng vẫn ko sao( như tôi chẳng hạn 😆) Army chúng ta thật là ""nguy hiểm"" 🤣🤣🤣"

Sự bất lực của NamJoon nhìn cưng ghê
"Lại 1 quả đánh úp giữa đêm của chị Lở :)) Nhưng ko sao, em quen với giờ giấc ra video giống tư bản của chị rồi"
"Ông Kook lúc ng ta trả lời thì cười ng ta, lúc tới mình thì ngơ ra nghĩ câu trả lời. Lở bị thiếu khúc NJ trl giúp JK, đoạn đó NJ kiên nhẫn vl =)))"
2:17 lại thêm 1 quả meme chất lừ :))
"Omeoi, tOMatOmAtO :))) E oxi hóa lời rùi đó Pít Jin ahhh"
Lần đầu tui xem lúc công chiếu của bà Lở đấy :))
Toàn ra đúng lúc mta handsome không dậy bà =)))

"हम आज़ाद परिंदे हैं, इश्क की ज़ंजीरों में जकड़ लो गे आप, क्यों पूछते हो कितनो हारा है दिल ये, सच बता ना पाएंगे और झूठ पकड़ लोगे आप।  छुपापाएंगे ना कुछ भी एक दूजे से, मन जो होगी वोह बात कहेंगे, कौन जाने किसने कब मरना है, बस एक वादा कर जब तक जिंदा हैं साथ रहेंगे।   कैसे जी पाएगा ये रिश्ता, वोह खफा रहते हैं और हमसे खिदमत नहीं होती, मिलने की तो दूर है जनाब, उनके पास तो बात तक फ़ुरसत नहीं होती।  लगी आग कुछ दिलों में हमें खुश देखकर, जो हमारे ही आंसुओ से बुझती है, सूई भी ना चुभे उनको अब उस कदर, जिस कदर हमारी मुस्कान चुभती है।  मनाते रहते वोह जब भी लड़ते हैं, पाने के बाद उन्हें खोने से डरते हैं, जो प्यार में पागल होते हैं, वो पागलपन में मरते  हैं।  छोड़कर जा चुके हैं एक दफा, अब देखना आते जाते रहेंगे, उनकी फितरत थी सताते रहना, सताते हैं सताते रहेंगे।  For more follow jazbaati_akhar on instagram or for song lyrics at free of cost DM 88929-22220 (wts app or text)"

The most angelic people while sleeping are bts
*BTS: sleep like an angel*  *Me: sleep like halfdeath zombie*

Why jimin is still cute while sleeping so cute ❤️💖💖😍😍
8:01 for min yoongi any place to sleep is good.
They are even cute when sleeping
BTS: Sleeping like cute babies Me: Sleeping like halfdeath zombie  😂😂🤣🤣. I wish u understand what I am trying to say😁🤣🤣
Exams are coming... Jungkook97:BTS sleeping moments Me:ohh nice...lets see how our boies sleeps😆😅😅😅
0:34 jimin looks like ken doll
5:36 Jimin all asleep😂
I remember when jhope kissed V on his forehead when V was in sleep ..that was adorable..
7:45 awww Jin is so cute🥺💜 Good night Jin.🥰💜
60% of suga sleeping  30% of tae sleeping  And 10% of others 😂
jimin is very cute when he sleeps
"9:35 Yashhh JK,  when I listened sound of Jimin ASMR, I literally feel sleepy too and feel relax."
Jimin is so cutee when he is sleeeping
I’m not first But I’m not last  But when Jungkook 97 post I click fast!
*The video title should be-* Angels sleeping cutely like Lil babies🥺
The most relaxing and happy moments of BTS!!!💜💜
JUNKOOK so CUTE 💙💙💙💙 RABBİT JUNGKOOK BABY💙💙💙💙💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
O Jimin lindo até dormindo ✋😔❤
90 percent of the video:Suga💫 Me:not shocked 😌👌
"They truly are ""Angels in Disguise"""
All bts are cute when sleeping cute like puppy's   . when  Joonkook sleep so funny ha ha ha ha ha and so cute .
*ALL OF JIN SOLOS:EPIPHANY* AWAKE🥺 TONIGHT😭 MOON🌎 ABYSS😌 I LOVE U😘 MOM🤗 AUTUMN OUTSIDE POST OFFICE😎
Jimin lips more poutier while sleeping
0:23 can someone tell me where can I find this full video
Suga will really do everything to make his sleep.
"Whenever i go to my hairstylist , i sleep and something like jimin and jungkook  but ... hairstylist is so humble that he couldn't wake me up so he asked his assistant to hold and gently move my head so i don't wake up. So i have my pic sleeping and i am getting a haircut , its literally like bts is sleeping whole their noona stylist are styling their hair."
*You know that You're Seriously A Goner When 7 grown@ss man's Sleeping Face is the Cutest thing in your eyes* ......👄✌
"Бедные,они так устают,ради нас.спят на ходу😩.какие они милые,как котятки маленькие😜😘💋💋💋💞💞💞обожаю их,особенно Чонгука💋💜"
*Seeing them sleep so cutely and comfortably....gives me energy 💜*
I love how Hoseok almost all the time cuddles the blanket while sleeping
Esto es lo mas adorable que he visto! Son todos unos angelitos durmiendo >w<
Bts:sleeping like cute little baby angles💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 Me:sleeping like a hedeast freak💀👺
80% of these clips are sleepy yoongi 🥺🤗💜
2:36 Hoseok looks so angry! 😂
I’m devastated. Jin sleeps in pout TT
Me: watching videos of adorable bts members sleeping Also me: almost falls asleep myself
Ya know it's legit when it's sleeping moments and yoongi appears first.....
They just spent the sleepless night only for ARMY happiness .. they are the world most cutest and adorable babies while sleeping
Seeing BTS sleeping makes me think that all angels..😇😍💜💜
JK and Suga= Kings of sleeping 😴
VMINKOOK looks so cute when they are asleep
Indian Army:    They are cute when they slepp
"when jin put his tie on jungkook’s mouth, he like puckered his lips instinctively omg that’s so cute"
5:28 okay but Jimin burying his face inte jk’s back is just cuteness overload
"Suga is a super hard working guy and a total savage.....BUT The way he sleeps is so adorable , comfortable and satisfying....."
Let’s not forget 0:22 TaeJin look so comfy lol
Bruh they are literally angels And notice how not one of them had a double chin while sleeping 😇😇😇
"You mean ""Jimin"" actually sleeps, he had me up all night replying back to 30 of his comments on Weverse, my anxiety got the better of me, l had no sleep. ""Aussie friend"""
I have to laugh that the stylists are probably so accustomed to it so they just hold their heads up and continue working. Kudos to them for being both professional and understanding.
Seeing all body slepping except Rm and jin 😂
"8:43,hobi: I should bring 8 more blankets for him .... Please he is so caring 💜💜"
Jhope sleep's so cutely
"1:10  ""... sleep like a winter bear ..."" 👼"

That one run episode where they all slept for half an hour and had to memorise the song 🤣
Jimin is so cute ❤️
"Bts: *sleep like angels*  Me: Sleeps like a potato, snore like a potato, and wake up like a potato 🥔"
BTS if sleeping is very funny while I sleep where from the bed to where I move where I wake up I don't realize if I'm sleeping when I stay quiet😂😂

Suga always does that mouth thing when he is sleepy.
"Even bts sleeps, they are so cute💜"

Quién no va a querer a J-Hope? Si es una extraordinaria persona
"no entiendo porque lo tratan así también es humano y tiene sentimientos, yo amo a hobi, es el solecito de army"
"Los que rechazan a J-HOPE no deberían tener derecho a llamarse ""ARMY""                                                                       Te amamos J-HOPE🥰🥰"
"""J-hope nunca fue valorado por fans"" Yo:Hay no,no me gusta que no lo valoren porque las K-Army,s son así eso me dolió 😭😭😭 Nosotr@s las L-Armys lo vamos a valorar porque J-hope es nuestro solecito 😍😍😘😊"
"Alguien más empezó a llorar desde el segundo 0:56?? No deje de llorar hasta el final de este vídeo, ARMY hay que demostrar muchísimo más el amor que le tenemos a JHOPE. El es nuestra esperanza,  solo su esperanza, y por eso mismo siempre tenemos que estar para el cómo el siempre lo está para nosotros"
"Todas lo queremos , J-hope es nuestro sol  sin el seria todo oscuro ."
"Yo si valoro ,quiero, amo a J-HOPE"
"Le agradezco a dios que nuestro solecito no se fue del grupo por que sin el no seria igual, sin el no habría tantas risas y corazones felices!!!!!! Solo las armys de corazón lo aman y lo apoyaran siempre y no lo criticaron ni lo rechazaran  Yo te amoooo mi J-hooooooope :''')"
"En Corea del Sur: te odiamos  En todo el mundo: J-hop eres lo máximo, te amamos. Seamos realistas no lo quieren en Corea. Pero siempre van a estar los fans extranjeros. 😁😁😁😁😁"
"Cuando dijo Madie me ha enviado una mensaje Llore me dio penita  verlo así :""c"
"Hobbi es un sol , no se xq le tiran mucho hate , el no ha hecho nada malo😭😭...Army xfavor cuidemoslo"
Me duele que no las demas personas no vean lo hermoso que es nuestro solecito☀️☀️☀️☀️
"Yo queriendome casar con el :""v"
"Soy Hobi biased. Él es un sol, demasiado talentoso"
J HOPE ES UN SER HUMANO MARAVILLOSO NO ENTIENDO COMO ALGUNAS FANS QUE SE DICEN LLAMAR ARMY LO PUEDEN LASTIMAR DE ESA MANERA 😡😡😡
"Tenemos claro que L-Armyn quiere, ama y valora a j hope más que K-Armyn"
Amo tanto a jhope. Me dolió escuchar y ver lo que le hicieron. Lo amo 💜🇦🇷☀️
No se por que a hobi le dicen que es mujer si el está tan hermoso el me ilumina mis mañanas con su hermosa sonrisa lo amoooooooooooooooo hobiiii!!!!!😭💖💖💖💖💖
Estuve bien triste por mi j-Hope :'(
cuando J-hope leyó la carta llore :’v
"él es tan hermoso, es el pegamento de bangtan, debemos valorarlo más  :("
Para J. Hope es simplemente adorable bello 😘❤️
J Hope es un sol y nunca se apagará
"Jhope es tan dulce, me encanta que siempre es animado y siempre está sonriendo"
"Todos y cada uno de los integrantes son valiosos para BTS, son una verdadera familia y gracias a, los siete nosotras sus ARMYS podemos gozar de su música, bailes, voces y sobre todo de sus bellos rostros. 😘 Adelante que tienen mucho camino por recorrer los amo. 😘"
"J-HOPE TIENE A ARMY Y EL ES NUESTRO SOL, SIN EL NO HAY LUZ  ARMY'S QUEREMOS A J-HOPE!!!"
Jhope lo vamos a querer mucho porque es la unica persona que nos hiso sonreir y sacar una sonrisas para todo el mundo
Para las personas que no aprecian a j jope estan muy ciegas  porque la mayoria de armi lo amamos  y lo adoramos cuantas personas no desean  que j jope o el resto de bts nos diga un hola  hay que apreciar  l que tenemos por ellos un dia ya no nos van a cantar mas
"Todos sabemos que L-army ama y valora el esfuerzo de nuestro solecito,y que estamos tan agradecidas de tener un excelente rapero e exelente persona en BTS."
j hoooooooooooooooope es nuestro hermoso SOLECITO
"La verdad que no entiendo a esas ""ARMYS"" Los 7 son talentosos y hermosos"
Apoyamos a todos no puede decir eso J-Hope si lo queremos o no porque yo siiii y si lo ehh valorado ehhh ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😘😘
Jhope: las fans no me quieren Yo: tu no me quieres pero yo te amo esa es la verdad tu presencia me esta matando
TE AMO J-HOPE  PORQUE TE TRATAN ASÍ 😭😭😭
todos aman a j hope y lo tienen que valorar
"No pueden considerarse Armys, aquellas que no quieren a alguno de los 7 integrantes."
"J-hope es una personita maravillosa, talentosa y con un corazón de oro, todas las Army te amamos, no nos abandones nunca. Amo a todos los chicos de BTS!!!"
"Me dieron ganas de llorar al ver eso.😭 Aquí tienes mi apoyo,yo sí le apoyo,de igual manera a todos los demás. J-Hope J-Hope J-Hope J-Hope.💜"
"J Hope es todo, es infravalorado, se merece lo mejor del mundooooo! :("
"En Occidente aman a J-hope, mepa que no es apreciado como se merece en Korea"
"el que no quiere a j-hope es que le tiene invidia por su talento en bailar y cantar, su hermosa mirada, su hermosa sonrisa y su hermoso rostro"
jhope es una buena persona es divertido quien no va querer a una persona asi es extraordinario
"Yo lo amo, no me imagino la vida sin mi solecito :''("
"Los siete son la combinación perfecta de BTS , son hermosos y muy profesionales TODOS Hope reciba un abrazo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"Yo si lo quiero J-Hope como una verdadera ""Army"" ❤ y ademas todos y todas lo queremos y obvio que a los demas tambien 😅"
"J-hope es un ángel,no merece tener odio,el sólo quería darnos amor y apoyo :("
"Hay que apoyarlo. La verdad cuando empezó el vídeo, sentí como si me atravesaran un cuchillo en el corazón, me puse muy triste ahora que se por lo que paso hobi lo voy apoyar con todas mis fuerzas. El se merece todo el amor de todas las ARMY's no entiendo como es que algunas armi no lo apoyan. El se esfuerza mucho, trabaja muy duro para lograr sus sueños y quiero ayudarlo a cumplirlos. Apoyemoslo!!!"
"Hobi te queremos,no,te amamos y no dejes q los antifan borren esas sonrisas haz q tu sonrisa cambien él mundo"
Me puse a llirar al ver que en el concierto de bts le daban el verdadero apoyo que hobi se merece tanto como perso y como cantante por sus grandes habilidades
J-HOPE ES UN ANGELITO! MALDITOS FANATICOS DE DICEN SER FANS Y PIDEN QUE SE EXPULSE A HOBIE!
yo amo a j hope ni siquiera puedo imaginar mi vida sin  hobi  el es una estrella demasiado grande  para tener el corazón triste  esas a.r.m.y.s  no saben lo que hacen.   cada vez que tengo un dia muy malo  j hope es quien me lo anima ❤ te amo j hope sigue brillando
"Hoseok es una de las personas más tiernas , amable y lindo !!"
Amo a los 7 integrantes yo valoro sus esfuerzos de cada íntegrante te amoo J-HOPE
Te queremos j hope tu eres la luz de bts te queremos somos tus fans
LA MAYORIA DE LAS ARMYS ADORAMOS A NUESTRO SOLCITO J-HOPE :'3
Todos queremos a jhope esperanza sin el quien nos daría luz en nuestros días tristes y oscuros
Llore al saber eso Jhope yo si lo amo 😍 es mi solecito es perfecta 😍 Jhope no merece ser tratado así el merece todo el amor de mundo mundial ❤️🤩 los demás también 😍💘 yo los amo a todos a los 7
Y pensar  que j hope es la persona más hermosa del mundo
Créeme k me duele mucho k los demás  fans k se hacen  llamar  ARMY  no acepten  a Jhope  pero  descuida  Jhope   yo te amo  y no te voy a dejar ir jamas
"_Me acorde del momento donde Hoseok estaba cantando y pidió a K-Army cantar y quedaron en silencio, pero cuando hizo lo mismo con L-Army todas cantaron, la sonrisa que puso fue hermosa, sigamos demostrando lo importante que Jhope en la vida de ARMY.💛_"
"Recuerdo el video de cuando su padre le llamo para felicitarle por su cumpleaños y la panzada a llorar que se echo Hope al escucharlo, todos los integrantes se emocionaron mucho. De todos es sabido que su padre no quería que Hope se dedicará a la música( ahora esta encantado que así sea y se siente muy orgulloso de su hijo), para Hope sentir que su padre lo apoya le hace ser Super feliz.  HOPE ES UNA PARTE MUYYYYYY IMPORTANTE DENTRO DE BTS Y BIG HIT."
Alguien más está esperando el cumple de jhope ??   Quiero hacer eso de mandar el vídeo gritando. (feliz cumpleaños jhope te amo) y mandar a las 2:18 de Corea
De lo único que me arrepiento es de no haber estado desde el inicio para apoyar a J-Hope:((
TnT J-hope tu eres suficiente no tiene preocupes
Pobre j-hope no se merece que lo menosprecien esas personas no son armys
y que j hope sepa que  las armys lo quiene mucho
Como no van a querer a j-hope si es re gracioso y aparte es un papucho
"H-hope es el sol más iluminante de mis días , yo lo amo a el"
Amemos a todos  Porque es un grupo de 7 chicos talentosos no solo un grupo de 3 o de 6 es de 7 y como no amar a hobi si el es un amor ❤ Amemos a todos ❤❤❤ 💜
"ARMY atención a nuestro hobi hermoso y a jimin le están tirando mucho hate por favor tenemos que protegerlo, denuncien a las cuentas que están haciendo eso en Twitter."
j hope  tiene que ser valorado al igual que todos los integrantes
Yo queriendo conocer a j Hope y otros hablando mal de el💓💔
J hope es hermoso y es nuestro sol enserio llore me siento muy triste pero debemos apoyarlo y lo amamos 💖💖
"Por favor,.ahora que se acerca su cumpleaños demostremos el gran amor que le tenemos a Hobi y brindemos mucho apoyo en las redes."
"BTS, J HOPE NUNCA FUE VALORADO POR LOS FANS? MENSAJES DE ODIO, SIEMPRE ESTUVIERÓN EN SU CONTRA yo : J-HOPE TIENE A ARMY Y EL ES NUESTRO SOL, SIN EL NO HAY LUZ  💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
"J-HOPE  ES TAN LINDO Y TIERNO COMO MO LO VAN A QUERER,  SIEMPRE SONRIE ES NUESTRO SOLECITO!😊💜😊💜😊🌼🌼🌼"
COMO ES POSIBLE QUE EXISTA PERSONAS QUE NO SEPAN VALORAR A UN HOMBRE TAN ESPECTACULAR Y TALENTOSO PARA MI Y MUCHAS TENEMOS MUY BUENOS GUSTOS AL AMARLO A MI SOLESITO HERMOSO J_HOPE . MI SOL
Todos queremos mucho a j hope
No entiendo como pueden existir personas que critiquen a una persona tan maravillosa como Hobi es un sol💜😍😍💜💜💜
“Los fans no me quieren..”  — _Eso será con K-army  (tienen favoritismo) porque L-army los quiere a TODOS por igual.._
A si es nuestro sol J hope nunca nos abandonaria
"Cuando dieron un concierto en Brasil y las fans empezaron  a gritar su nombre se puso de lo más feliz, pobre Hobi merece más amor si el es una hermosa persona. No te preocupes nosotras las L-armys te amamos lo que las K-armys no."
J-hope  lo amo es muy guapo es la Alegría del grupo no se que haríamos sin el
Yo le amo a j-hope es una persona tan linda y tiene cara de bb a mi me encanta y las q no están mal de la cabeza  una persona tan extraordinario no se merece estar triste 💜💜te amo j-hope sos un principe 💜💜
Porque no lo quieren 😢 Las ARMYS lo queremos mucho 💜
j-hope es hermoso y con mucho talento y quien diga que no está muy equivocado te amo j-hope
"Metas para Army/stream Life goes on:300m fire:200m/800m idol,fakelove,mic drop y dynamite: 1 billon es muy importante difundir🌁 JHOPE ES UN SOL COMO PUEDEN ODIARLO?"
Díos! Cómo es posible que exista gente que no le guste ese solecito tan hermoso?🤩 Los 7 BTS son maravillosos pero yo vivo enamorada de esa sonrisa tan encantadora de J-Hope🥰
Soy la única que lloró cuando vió a Hobi llorando....? 😢😢
HOBI ES UN ANGEL! ME DA UNA RABIA PORQUE NO ESTUVE CUANDO NO RECIBIA APOYO! 😢😭😭😭
"Yo no estoy llorando, tu estas llorando?   Me duele, me quema, me arde, me lastima, me mata... ver como Hobi era tratado antes yo encerio lo amo demasiado, nunca lo haría de menos ni a el ni a ningun otro chico de BTS  Si lloré TT"
Es el mejor j hope quien no lo va admirar si sonrisita es la que nos alegra y lo hace especial
J.HOPE ES EL SER MAS BRILLANTE DE ESE GRUPO SU ALEGRIA LLEGO HASTA COLOMBIA. HE DICHO
Como le puedo mandar una carta a J-HOPE.  No....... me puse a llorar cuando jimin le entrego las pocas cartas... Grasias por aser este video . A pesar de que me puse a llorar
"Sinceramente no entiendo a las personas, como pueden odiar a personas que no les han hecho daño :("
wow que armys mas mal de la cabeza todas las armys amamos por igual a nuestro j-hope hermoso... te queremos j-hope
J HOPE es el sol que ilumina nuestros días y siempre nos saca una sonrisa  Army's amamos a J HOPE💜
"Nosotras sus Armis lo queremos y lo apoyamos por ser una persona muy bonita,inteligente, cariñosa y muchas cosas mas que lo hace tan especial.TE QUEREMOS J HOPE😘😘"
Las Armyns  queremos a todos por igual todos son valiosos para nosotras
En fin las armys verdaderas apoyamos y amamos a todos.

"I am 65,and I love  BTS! They are so talented 😍"
Verlos progresar en su carrera es la mayor alegría de ARMY  Pdta:no dejemos que nos roben vistas
Can you IMAGINE what this would be in a stadium? The boys and army singing their HEART out. You CANNOT stay seated while this plays. It’s such a fun and carefree song. Cannot wait ´till we get to attend a concert and support Bangtan like they deserve !
idk why but the beginning just hits different

Ahora debemos apoyarlos en su nueva canción que salió hoy agamos stream
The real question is how can Taehyung looks so good in literally any outfit?
الارمي العرب وينكم  يلا اثبات وجودكم هههههه بمزح بس عنجد جيمييييين كشخه هون وهيبة اكتر من الفيد الاصليييي💜💜
Taekook with that matching outfits! They're killing me ..
Popular opinions : Kim Taehyung is the most perfect man in the world ! ! ! 💜💜💜BTS IS the best group music of world ! ❤
"I'm Hobi biased, but after watching this performance over a million times...Jimin and V's outfits did something to me."
kim taehyung the man you are today
Seeing Yoongi's empty space is so sad :(( I'm glad he's better now!
2:40 me smiling like an idiot by seeing his smile.

"So here's the thing, our 8th BTS anniversary goal is to make ""NO MORE DREAM"" hits 1B. I know it sounds difficult but we have to do itm BTS always thought that their debute was not a bop and success and they feel it's cringe and didn't want to look back at it. If we armys hit it to 1B, they probably will realize that they were Kings before and now too. Let's make their debute 1B Armys. I know we can. Share this as much as possible on every platform and in various languages. Let's do it!"
ME EMOCINE MUCHO AL COMIENZO QUIEN NECESITA EXPLOSIONES CUANDO BTS CON SU VOZ SON LA VERDADERA DYNAMITE.
jin is handsome. i'll never be bored to say it again n again :(

"amazing music with an awesome cryptid designer and an epic dancer, this is mwah chef's kiss"
Dude if some guy danced at me like that ill be like bruh don't throw your mojo at me...you know i can't handle it
where do you even get wii remotes THAT big
"Yo so the creature design WAS Trevor Henderson? It definitely holds his design type, so I was curious. Also, music is absolutely banging and the moves are smoother than butter like DAMN."
When you just wana dance but mama wont let you
Makes sense it's Casey Frey considering he's basically a living cryptid same as Martin Cabello and Sam Hyde.
of fucking COURSE it was casey frey
"milkblood, mike diva, casey frey, trevor henderson is more ambitious of a collab than endgame"
I want the alien to make a dance tutorial. So my dance moves can be out of this world.
Leaked footage of scientist trying to recreate such moves.
I like Milkblood. He's a guy who just wants to dance.
I anxiously anticipate further behind the scenes footage
Daam I knew it was him  That moves of the creature were so smooth it can be only Casey power stance
"It was Casey Frey, let's fucking go. What a coincidence, i just found out about milkblood today and happened to be watching old casey frey videos earlier"
I would watch 1 hour of this alien dancing to thidms song.  Effects guys included
"Can’t tell you how many times I’ve shared this song, you guys are slick"
"No cap, I listen to this daily"
I’ve been bumping this song since Mike Diva posted the music video. It’s a bop that won’t go stale.
Impressive and cute
Legend says he never stopped dancing again...
The perfect dance step doesn't exi-
"They say that he disappeared when we needed him most. That's not it, it was just he was with us in a different form.  A form that we all failed to recognize. CASEY FREY THE MAN HIMSELF."
"that alien came to us at the end of one of the worst years some of us have ever gone through, and just like that everything feels good again"
Hold up are you telling me this meme lord is involved in the creation of this outstanding song?    I'm getting Joji vibes again.
"I just want to see full uncut video of Casey dancing to the song, thats all"
"Я даже не могу решить, кто из них харизматичнее :)"
time to study this video for 3 days straight to become the ultimate shmoover
Making me really want to dress up as a cryptid and bust sweet moves
"My dudes, I’m so goddamn obsessed. Please, please, please, more of this visual and more of this vibe. Fucking excellent"
I keep coming back to this song and video. It haunts me.
"I'm big happy that they are starting to make original dances instead of using the default ones the 3D program has, it really adds to the character"
"honestly this scared me when i first saw it, and then it became somewhat wholesome when he started dancing lol"
"dude, i can't stop watching this."
So glad we finally got to see what Casey looks like in real life on the right
Casey our multi-talented King killin it
"Bro,, little homie's vibes are absolutely immaculate"
"I really love the fluidity in Casey's body; I watch this little preview thing a few times a day just for the motions, it's so satisfying and amazing."
I truly understand why that girl running from him now Just imagine suddenly some of your parent that still alive suddenly do this infront of you You wouldn't get close would you?
Man all he wants to do is dance but his mother said he's weird just let that scp be all he wants is love 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can we get the full mocap? I wanna see more of that
"He's got some good dance moves, not gonna lie XD"
"Now i want to see the entire Mocap, thanks"
I dont know why but i really wanna see the rest of this dance or the irl person with that setup and styrofoam arm things
He's doing the ritual to save us from 2021
You guys have no idea how excited I am about this year for music. Were gonna get some awesome shit. And MILKBLOOD already a fan. I'm excited to see where our cute monster goes dancing to.
Love how the arms were made longer by Styrofoam
I KNEW IT only Casey can move like that!!
what kind of dance is this I lowkey want to learn the moves damn
we need a full version of this
finally we get to see who is really behind this awesome dancing monster.
What an amazing amalgam of talent to create this creative masterpiece
i cant stop replaying this
I love it when artists show how their craft is made. Good stuff!
"If we get him to 1mil subs i bet he will make a 1 hour or a 56 minute video of that alien thing dancing i would literally be listening to that everywhere i go and that,s (FACTS)"
"i watch the video clip 6 times, the animation is too good"
It’s just too damn smooth...
i knew i had a feeling that i recognized those moves from somewhere
this was honestly something to see for the first time. i enjoyed every second of it.
Bra that was fire dancing ngl
This is one of the best music videos ever
I listen to this song multiple times every day. it's addicting to my ears!
"YOOOOOOO, I knew that movement was familiar"
When a bruh from halfway across the world glances at a pixel of your face.
damn need more behind the scenes I love watching you dance :))
I love this behind the scenes
Researching mocap suits led me here....I'm not disappointed in the slightest
i should have known it was him the groove is on POINT
One of the best songs ever I am so thankful for fin ding this song at the start of its life along with all other Milkblood songs
it took me a while to realize the mocap was taken in the same hallway as the actual clip
"bruh, I love the end and all of em 😂❤️"
"Love your content man. Really inspirational, creative and unique."
Good to see Casey still makin moves ❤
I want a full video of this. I need more.
"ALgorith broght me here first. Thank you youtube, for the first time in forever"
I am now depressed because the beautiful monster isn’t real but the dancing is fire
Off The Air - Dreams
Thanks for showing us the dancers efforts!
"So cool. Incredible dancing, and fantastic model by Henderson"
I'd love to see a more in depth bts ! Especially more with casey. It's so cool to see the work that goes into incredible projects like these and seeing his dance moves then the process of applying them to the creature (adoringly called the schmover in my friendgroup) is really neat!
I'm so excited to see where this goes
"Amazing song, amazing video. Love the story and character design."
Can we have the entire video mocap'd please?
Lovin the foam reference arms
Pure art!!!
Holy Shit Dude! You made your YouTube account like 1 month ago and you have 13.7k subs. Also great video love it
Let’s all remember this is the same man that was going to act up and do something he was going to regret.
Casey frey so you've been the *schmover* all along?! We miss you man please post more
Love this! Had to draw the creature too; dig the music and dig the design and OOO that dancin' <3 <3
So good to see Casey still doing his thang 🤙
you guys nailed it with this video/song.
"Damn, that is some dancin alright, loving it"
This is f***ing amazing!
"tell me, how'd you find this art."
I want to practice dancing like this but I can't find a tutorial for it anywhere
I knew i knew those moves! Casey you Alienated Crazy!
I require more.
You are my spirit person!
Dude the music video was amazing
Anyone know what these dance moves are called? Wanna learn them so bad!
"Holy shit, amazing"
THIS IS WAY WAY WAY TO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ugh please we need a rockstar JK or rockstars BTS PLEASE
Okay Jungkook cheat on his Banana milk.
Jungkook’s voice is KILLING ME DO YOU UNDERSTAND!!?!?
"Jungkook: ""oh won't you follow me into the jungle?"" Me: yessssir aint gotta tell me twice"
Jungkook sounds very sexy!
if they create songs like this for their future album I’ll probably just evaporate
I wish jk voice was like this on more BTS songs
"Jungkookie😭😭😭😭 Jungkook's vocals is out the world😘. If bts comes out with an album that sounds anything like this, Army's all over the world r gonna die."
Jungkook as a Rockstar where the wattpad gang at 😳😳😳😳🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪
"OK, now I need JK to do a rock song. This boi is truly golden"
Keep Jungkook in the middle when he is literally singing the full song. He deserves it for this absolute amazing singing.
Jungkook's vocal skills are no joke  he's the best main vocalist
Jungkook voice is so perfect it blends in every type of music & song. If Coca cola releases a complete version of the song with BTS it will be like fire in the jungle.
Me: JK's voice can't possibly get gotter  JK: sings rockstar style  My ovaries: dead
SAY IT WITH ME  : ROCKSTAR JUNGKOOK YUP
Jungkook is killing it 🔥🔥🔥🔥
JUNGKOOK'S VOCALS ARE INSANE! HE'S SUCH A VERSATILE SINGER HE CAN PULL OFF ANY GENRE OF MUSIC FLAWLESSLY
*Jungkook always the best vocalist* 👌👑❤
Amazing vocals of rockstar Jungkook there. He is indeed very versatile.
JK'S VOCALS IS SO DAMN GOOD😭❤
Amazing vocal always Jungkook
Damn!! rockstar jungkook vocals!
ROCK STAR🎸⭐️ JUNGKOOK🔥
Jungkook vocals are insane
JK our vocal king!!!!! 👑
Jungkook: won’t you follow me into the jungle Me : yes
Jungkook's voice is killing me😍🔥💜🖤🔥
Jin's voice is very recognizable for me. I know his voice so much. The vocal line is killing this. Jungkook rockstar.. Damn.. They're all so good.
Coca cola knows what they're doing. What a catchy song and some mad good vocals damnn
Jungkook's voice is very good ❤️💜
Jk is killing it
"this is really good, saying it not just because it is sung by BTS but the melody is really good.  it could be a big hit if it were a complete song by BTS. also noticing that Jungkook is getting better and better singing in English. his English skills is getting better as time goes by. or at least he is getting better and more comfortable singing English song. in this commercial song he sings probably 70% of it.  if BTS released a complete English album, it would sell like more than hot cakes worldwide."
I know Jk is versatile and great BUT this is insane...what more genre is left for kook?? And the english is immaculate😱😱😳😳 I need a rock song in JJK 1 asap! Jin...jimin...V vocals too...damn! Manifesting bts rock album!
what if someone said this isn’t Jungkook 😭 everyone: wha-😃
"JK PLEASE LET US, YOUR ARMY, HEAR YOU SING JUNGLE LIVE !!!!!!!!  OUR FUTURE GOLDEN ROCKSTAR !!!!!"
JUNGKOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jungkook just killed it
Me: JK's voice can't possibly get gotter  JK: sings rockstar style  My ovaries: dead
Whaaaaa what if they put a song like this in their next album like a rock star OMG jungkook gonna kill me if he sing showing his tattoo :-0
"As a former Indonesian Coca-Cola employee, this is the first time i really regret leaving."
"All the vocal line’s vocals fit this song so well. Even though Jimin, Jin, and V sang as background vocals you could still hear how amazing they sounded and Jungkook sounded phenomenal"
Why Jk's vocals are soooo magical✨
"BTS vocals are amazing, and Jungkook voice is out of this world!!"
JUNGKOOKS VOCALS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 This man is toooo perfect I can't.....
A voz do jungkook sobresai ❤️
Jungkook's voice sounds like he's really an American
WOW JUNGKOOK VOICE NEVER DISAPPOINT ME!!!!
I'M JUST PRAYING THAT THIS COVER IS ACTUALLY SUNG BY THE VOCAL LINE BECAUSE IF IT IS- JUNGKOOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKK- THEY REALLY POPPED OFF
We need rockstar jungkook for JJK1
broooooooo rockstar Jungkook is KILLING ME
Jungkook killed me how awesome his vocals
Damn Jungkoooookkkk
Jeon Jungkook~~~~!!!!!!
Whatever they sing it becomes tremendous.. They're way more amazing... And here JUNGKOOK KILLED IT!!!
"vocal line popped off, jungkook's lower register tho 😳"
MANIFESTING ROCKSTAR JUNGKOOK
"If this the commercial ad song😱😱😱😱😱😱 Then we should imagine their next album 🙏🙏🙏🙏🤯🤯 And specially Kookie, your voice is killing me....😭😭💜"
Fact: This is an ad in Indonesia I'm so happy🇮🇩💜
Oh My Kookie Stay blessed boy Nd congratulations BTS
I LOVE IT wow Jungkook.
JK's vocal...
I'm screaming JUNGKOOK
gshdjudujwu JUNGKOOK IS KILLING MEEE  TT
I'm mad that this was for a commercial where my full song at😡
"ISTG IF BTS CREATED A SONG LIKE THIS, HALF OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION WOULD WIPE OUT."
Our rockstar jungkook😎😎😘😘😘😍😍😍
"Jungkook , vmin and jin the vocal line of the century .! PERIOD."
The way they always steal our souls whether its a commercial or they're playing is amazing
I'm in love with the song.  Jungkook...  I'm shook
OMG THIS TYPE OF JK'S VOCALS!! I CAN'T HANDLE IT HOW THE TF IS HE SO VERSATILE
Jungkook... Omg
"El mejor comercial, la voz de jungkook es hermosa... 💜💜💜"
Everyone - jungshook over the rockstar voice in coke ad  🤯 Me - umm... Spirte??😬
"""Oh Won't you follow me"" by jungkook hits different"
se imaginan a jungkook en una pelicula de netflix o disney con esta cancion llegando como el popular de la escuela entre los pasillosss SOLO IMAGINENSELOOOO
"_""ROCKSTAR VOCAL LINE""_"
Jk VOCALS! And he did sound like an american ! I felt so attacked.
Кто пришёл сюда после трансляции Чонгука 😹👍
I have listened to this a hundred times but still not done with it.
Jungkook's voice *unmatched!!!*
The coco cola all over the world is going to get sold out for us ARMY'S
Jungkook vocals are always amazing
I need a complete song made in studio 😱
"Wow, it really didn't sound like Jungkookie unless you think the adlibs was him. It was only after V and Jinie started singing that it became more apparant it was BTS. 😳 JK's voice is very different here. lol. 🇺🇸💜"
"Rockstar Jungkook, 우리 메보 정국이 너무 잘한다👍"
I can hear Jimin's voice 💜💜💜💜
"if bts made a full english album with these kind of songs/beat and jungkook singing like this, they would literally dethrone everyone :O"
Jhope can't relate to this song Jhope is living his life with spaghetti and sprite.
"Can we please not ignore V, Jin and Jimin. They sounded so good😭💜"
tenemos que admitir que la única voz que se escucha es kook😂😍 su voz es magnífica dios
Jungkook omg Rockstar
"WHEN I SAY JK SLAYED, I MEAN IT."
"Armys, podemos hacer de esto comercial algo viral.  La canción es buena, el comercial también. Y no se sabe que es BTS.  Es el escenario perfecto para hacerlo viral, por ende moda, y que la ignorancia sobre BTS disminuya...  ARMYY PERDEMOS LA OPORTUNIDADDD"
At first (when i didn't have headphones) i couldn't believe it because it doesn't seems like it's Jungkook's voice until i put my headphones.. i didn't even hear Jin and Tae when i listened with headphones until i felt on this video-
Why can’t I hear any difference in Taehyung’s voice and Jungkook’s..I MEAN FOR REAL THEIR VOICE IN THIS IS SOOOO CLOSE
*j-hope and his sprite have left the chat*
Jungkook: oh won't you follow me into the jungle Army: I'm coming I'm coming
Bts sempre dando o seu melhor em tudo que faz adorei esse comercial da coca cola que eles participaram fico muito lindo 👏🏻👏🏻😍💞☺
Imagine if they had a comeback with this vibe ... It would be the end for us

Imagine hating K-pop and literally copying their music Shame!! They should stop this!!
No one can copy them they r seven wonders of ARMY's world.💜
How to steal an army girl's heart- Learn everything about bts. 😂😂
Bollywood: copies a song from BTS  Me: Hey stob it
You can steal our music but not our success             - Lil meow meow
"ARMY: why bollywood copy our BTS  Bollywood wale: ""soo what""  😂😂😂😂"
Copying BTS songs proves that they reached at the top that people are trying to become like them  & Not giving them credit shows that haters are unable to do that hardwork and got burned in jeleous.
Bollywood - Let's copy this song of BTS!  BTS - You can copy songs but you can't copy ou success
V rendar Su gendar Jin endar Ju gendar Rap ender Jimin ender J hope ender🤣🤣🤣
"When a Bollywood song is used in an editing video of BTS, I find out that such a Bollywood song exists.😂😂😂😂 Purple you BTS.... 💜💜💜💜"
"At this rate , Suga's 3 dollar chain has more respect than bollywood songs😂😂"
The names he gave for the members...I'm dying lmfao 🤣🤣🤣
BTS has not copied anyone They are here because of their own talents which lead to their success
Army be like : utha le re deva utha le mere ko nahi inko utha le
I want that burj khalifa ad for RM too😇😇 He deserves it soo much

"Bollywood movies: copied Bollywood style: copied Bollywood songs : copied Wow But BTS song they can't , they can't do that."
EAST OR WEST OR SOUTH OR NORTH BTS & ARMY IS THE BEST...💜
"Its 3 in the morning and i m spposed to be asleep like everyone else in my house is but at 1:59, i began laughing extremely loud... guys i m dead, i m so dead"
Ye hote virender Ye hote sugender Ye hote jinender Ye hote jugender Ye hote rapender Ye hote jimender Ye hote jhopender HELP I am wheezing💀
The only thing other can't copy is their authentic humble personality.
"Bhai dilkhush hogya ... literally dude! , this fact must be known by everyone ! 'Borahae Armii>3!"
"At this moment BTS be like: calm down, calm down my daughter they can't copy our success and fandom..😌"
LET'S NOT COMPARE RM TO ANY OTHER MAIN STREAM BOLLYWOOD RAPPER
Suga's 3 dollar chain is more famous than bollywood song ...
"LETS BE HONEST, THIS TOPIC DOESNT SUPRISE US NOW ""of bollywood copying kpop songs""........................."
*You can steal my music but not my sucess* -------MIN Yoongie💜💜💜😊😊😊😊
This shows where does BOLLYWOOD stands... No words to express

Last one was funniest J-Hopen der😂😂
The way he changed their names I can't with this guy-🤣🤣🤣
When will Bollywood stop copying!!!! I'm trusfrated now!!!!!! 🔪
2:39 correction please!  Raftaar wasn't envolved because the set is always designed by the director's team. Many of the people don't even bother to know about theirs set untill it really shows some meaning. So I would say if the music isn't copied then don't blame Raftaar because set is always like 99% times is only designed by the crew
1:96 Amazing Names !! 😂😂😂 Jungkook turning to Jungendar 🤣🤣🤣 Suga turning to Sugender 🤣🤣 Hilarious af!!
You can copy our song but not our success -Min Yoongi

BTS: Like Bollywood :Comment
He himself is an army 👏
Proud to be Army 😘🥰😍💜
Alternate name of Bollywood : Drugs aur coppppyyyyyy  Edit:  99% of Bollywood is trash now but the remaining 1% is loved by us. Don't fight 🙂
I seriously love this guy in this video he is literally saying the words in my mind
"People think that,BTS is Not Famous in India  Then wait guys,when their concert will held in India,you will get to know: Army has No Nation Boundries  Army and BTS are connected through Feelings and Not by Nationality  Borahae BTS💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
I jus burst in laughter when he said yeh hote surendar yeh and all that
"""BTS"" and ""don't laugh"" are two words that just are impossible together 😅"
"""try not to laugh"" *BTS appearing* Me: laughing like an idiot   Edit:Thanks for the likes LmAOoo❤️❤️Mom...I'm famous"
Can anyone talk about jin's laugh HEHEHEHE LmAo
"Everyone needs jin's purely blessed laugh in their lives... 😌😌  EDIT: today me frmd watched this video and scrolled down through comments and found this comment of mine... And she send me the ss of it asking.... ""bish.. Is that you!... OMO! You are famous! I'm a celebrity's frnd"".. 😂 😂 😂 But the fact she doesn't know is that, this is my least liked comment 🤣🤣🤣🙌"
I lost as soon it started😂😂
i dont laugh but passed out
"Jin : HEY , STOB IT !!! JK : he said stop it Jin : how do u spell that ?! JK and Jin : S-T-O-P  I-T  JK : boom !!! Jin : yeah !!! Jimin : * dying by laughing *   ALWAYS leJINdary🤣🤣😂😂"
Others came here for the challenge while i came here to laugh 😆
Few hours ago i was crying alot but after watching them i am really happy and laughing like a bullfrog ( armys you know what i mean😁).
"""try not to laugh"" Armys: Starts laughing even before the vid starts"
I laughed so much when Hobi kept getting sprayed with water for laughing 😂😂😂
"“Jimin is known for his small legs in BTS” Me:”nope, I think that's his hands!”"
Einsteinium 😂😂😂 Science students be like - reallly🤐🤐
Why are we even trying not to laugh? 😂
“Me laughing like a maniac in each clip”   Jin saying STOB IT made me die of laughter
Jin's legendary horse laugh will forever remain legendary
I laughed within the first 5 seconds of the video then died
I was trying to hold my laugh but when I heard Jin’s iconic “EhEheeHhEe” I just cracked up
"Nooo this was the first time I actually wanted to stay serious, but... the pinkies... I can‘t T_T"
Seeing jimin oppa in the thumbnail  ; made me laugh 😂😂  Of course u know I lost !! Anyway thank you for this !!
on 4:48 junkook eyes looks so cute like a baby wake up in the morning ^^
LET US ALL SAY HONESTLY WE ALL CAME HERE TO LOSE
jin is still world wide handsome when he wakes up
6:25 what an iconic 😂 laugh of jimin
Her: you can't laugh Me: nodding like a toddler getting a prize 1 minute later *laughs like there's no tomorrow*
6:27 is that laugh Jin’s?! 🤣- I passed out
When you are trying to be serious...  Jin: Laughs   Me: Dies in laughter
That guy got some guts to join the group and replace Jimin😂😂😂
Jin's so cute in here
Bruh at this point I don’t even care if its “try not to laugh challenge”. I watch these videos mainly so i can laugh.
I lost at 0:48 😩 I never realized how small jimins hands were 😭
I didn't even know that it was “try not to laugh challenge”.. I see bts I click
Who lost like  Because I want to know how many army r watch because we can't stop it
I was laughing hard seeing the title  and after I clicked the video I felt like passing out. BTS IS LIT! 😝😂✨
11:05 I KNOW THAT SONG IT WAS THE INTRO SONG FOR BOYS OVER FLOWERS BUT I DO AGREE :P
I try to hold my laugh but i can't after hearing jin laughing😂😂😂
"No this is not ""try not to laugh challenge"" it is laughing challenge 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
I really love the way jin's laughing😀😁
"""Jin, why does your laugh sound like washing windows?"" 😂😂🤣🤣🤣"
"I was smiling like an idiot the whole time, but I lost it when Jin introduced himself as WWH, soon followed by Jamie Dornan giving them a look that said he wanted to go 50 shades on them."
This is hard because I laugh when they laugh
She say dont laugh .. me after jimin fall .. face first
Did jin seriously laughed like a horse....how did he do that?????❤️💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
(Jin having 2 glasses) Jin: removes one from eyebrows Army's: ... Jin: removes one from eyes Army's: OMG!!! WORLD WIDE HANDSOME!!!
J-Hope with Rose Gold hair is mmm chef's kiss
I didn't lost it till the end but that J-Hope incident it made me go crazy... Lol we cannot stop laughing if BTS is around and specially if there is J-Hope and Jin😂😂😂😂
I lost in the starting itself when jin appeared with goggles 😂🤣💜 Who else  👇👇
"""BTS"" and ""don't laugh"" are two words that just are impossible together 😅"
That jhope oppa getting sprayed of water that just kill me everytime 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Let me tell you BTS full form army's              B-born  T-to S-shine  😉Bye I hoped I helped you 💜💜
is super funny i can't hold my laughter as soon as jin appear i started to laugh
KOOKIE: EINSTEINUEM EINSTEIN:........................
6:26 Jin laugh like a horse😅😅😅 I can't stop laughing with this videos and the laugh of Jin
Jin's laugh is our oxyjin
WHEN JIN SAID 'sToB iT' I couldn't take it anymore
"I was fine until Jin said "" you look like a pig "". That's the moment I lost it."
11:50 when jimin said sorrY- omg that killed meeeee
"Ok I really lost as soon as the video started and ""BTS TRY NOT TO LAUGH (BTS Funny Moments)"" is impossible for all the ARMYs..."
We all need a friendship like Jin and jimin
I failed very badly when Jin started laugh like a horse
Okay this was the most funniest “try not to laugh challenge “ I almost peed my pants 😭😂😂😂
8:57 I would give all of my life savings to them. Cuz they are my life actually all the seven of them ❤️❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜💜
"""Try not to laugh""  me: *laughing at every moment, even in the intro*"
i can't jin's laugh literally gets me EVERYTIME
Bts try not to laugh me : ik from the begging I'll loose
"i was like ""THE MOMENT I STEPPED IN I ALREADY LOSE"""
9:42 the way Jk says yes sends me
no one: jin's laugh: HEHEHEHEHEHE
i lost at 11:49 when jimin said sorry like a little school girl LMAO
3:54 do u ever wonder what going in his mind XD  I cant with jinXD
Jhopes 'uh' was enough to make me forget about the title
*JIN and JK : talking about science  meanwhile ME: who cant stop laughing
i love how she said hella jin lmao edit: hello*
The silence BTS gave when she asked them a question-
I try not to laugh Me : Laugh when Jimin and Tae Tae make the thing with they fingers😂😂
1:05 Hobi’s face tho 😂 😂
I wonder how Jin managed to make that laugh sound
YO WHEN JIN SAID YOU LOOK LIKE A PIG I STARTED CRYING OF HOW MUCH I WAS LAUGH!!
La risa de jin me da vida
Also 14:17 - 16:33 was too funny when J-Hope doesn't understand why he kept on being sprayed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's hard to make Suga laugh
Me: *trying not to laugh* Bts: *just looking at the camera* Me: *burst out of laughter*
BTS 💜❤️💜💜💜💜❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
"I lost mostly at the last parts where they were ""students"""
Funfact : Everyone came her to laugh🤣🤣😂😂
I  laughed very hard when jungkook and j hope were saying uh and and the water keep sprinkling on them 😂🤣😂😂 Fun fact : I came here only to  laugh not for challenge
"The fact that I've watched almost all the clips in this video. But still decided to end it and still, BTS was able to made me laugh so hard HAHAHA! LOVE U BTS!!!"
Thanks ami I love this edit 😅🤣 I laughed like a crazy bit*h  after crying 2 hrs💜💜💜
"It's simple, when jin laughs I laugh 😌"
It's hard not to laugh or chuckle when you see Hobie being sprayed with water and giving priceless reactions and laughter to the audience and BTS
BTS and TRY NOT TO LAUGH are impossible together🤣 Jm: little pinkie BTS: all laugh Me: AWWWW😭 1:40 the oldest can’t be mad with the cuter/shortest/helpless🤧🥺
"The fact that I watch these ""BTS try not to laugh compilation"" to actually laugh. I am not okay I--"
i laughed at only when jin said hey stob it
dear Armies' Stop expecting us to not laugh on such messed up shits of BTS. We can never accomplish such task. Thank You : )
6:27 that’s one of the reasons I love them so much
They are the cause of my euphoria...❤😆
JIN'S LAUGH I CANT
I forgot it was don't laugh challenge as soon as it started.. I just checked the title at last and I can't process 😅
6:26 When the Demon in my room is watching this video with me....
Jin's horse laugh always get's me

How many did you get right? (be honest!)
Rich and Joel: sing every songs  Chris: follow the boys  Erick: tries  Zabdiel: de Jesus
mori cuando Joel miro a Richard y empezaron a recordar la letra de dynamite segundos despues chris recuerda el nombre de la cancion UWU
Se nota que Joel y Richard escuchan mucha música en Inglés.
Zab and Erick are lost in their own world...uff cuties!!
"Imagínate ser fan de estos grupos  ( BTS , CNCO , ONE DIRECTION , 5SOS )"
Sorry no superó como Chris le cantaba perfect a Joel jajaja
*A.R.M.Y Entrando al chat*     I LOVE CNCO AND BTS
"Espero que con este video comprueben que nunca hubo ni hay ni existirá una RIVALIDAD entre CNCO y BTS , ellos escuchan música de ellos por les gusta obvio ✨solo son las fans tóxicas que crean toda esta rivalidad como siempre :c ✨"
"CNCO COMO SIEMPRE FUERON UN AMOR CON LOS BTS, y algunas  armys no lo quieren aceptar. Por favor dejen de crear rivalidades donde no lo hay. Gracias"
*todo el reto consiste en adivinar la letra y el nombre de la canción*  CNCO: murmuran la letra y adivinan el artista 😂😂😂😂
Nadie va a hablar de la forma en que se miraron Rich y Joel cuando sonó Dynamite?
"Viene por el título ""BTS"" y la verdad me quede hasta el final del video! Son todos muy lindos.💜"
"No entendí ni mergas pero ok, todo por ver a los Zienziu 👁️👄👁️✊"
"Cnco sin saber las letras: *tararean, dicen una palabra de toda la canción y siguen tarareando*   Yo: poético"
CNCO SINGING BTS — AM I DREAMING
"Ya sabia que a Joel Pimentel le gustan las canciones de BTS, con esto me lo confirma y eso me encanta, amo verlo tan emocionado y feliz"
"Vieron como chris se quedo mirando a Joel a partir del min 2:54 JAJAJAJAJ asi miro yo a Joel con mi carita de enamorada cada vez que lo veo, dedicandole canciones, es imposible no mirar a ese hermoso bombom😍 amo esa linda amistad, los amo"
JAJAJAJAJJAJAJAJJAJAJAJJAJAJAJAJA y nadie habla de que Chris se sabe los bailes de tik tok  Pero ahora la pregunta es pa cuando nos sube videos haciendo los bailes
I just read “One Direction” and i’m here 😳 just that
En el título: BTS   ARMY: vine más rápido que el rap de Suga 👁️👄👁️
"Porque están tan pendientes de CNCO? Por favor  no vengan acá tirar mala onda, si  no te gustan o no te simpatizan, fácil ignoralos, no se compliquen la vida. Esto es contenido solo para fans. Ok? ☺😌😌"
¿Podemos hablar de como Erick movió su cabeza y lo tierno que se veía haciéndolo? ✨
"Solo las fans crean rivalidad, donde no la hay."
"I'm a simple person, I see CNCO x 5SOS and click to watch"
CNCOwner que se respeta anda aquí sin entender nada xD
I see BTS CNCO ONE DIRECTION 5SOS i faint
"alguien mas se dio cuenta que el que canta mas fue joel , chris y richard 😍👀  ps erick y zabdiel : papi que hacemossss , solo escuchemos que hacen jajaj 🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♀️ muero , muero 😵😹😹"
"En los trabajos grupales soy Zab.... En reuniones familiares soy Rich... Con mis amigxs soy Joel... Con mis primxs soy Christopher xD... Y en el fandoms soy Erick, aveces tranqui y aveces loca :v... De tal Zienziou tal Zienziouner xD :'v"
"Todos felices porque tarareo Dynamite de BTS y yo bien pinche contenta porque se sabían la de mis Wandi ""Story of my life"" 😭😭 love CNCO love ONE DIRECTION 😢😍😍"
chris knew the songs but he wasn’t getting any of the lyrics right loool
"En una parte cuando Joel y chris se miraron cantando con tanta emocion, me parecio muy tierno y gracioso a la vez Jajaja love you"
Como army y cncowner esto me parece una joyita😍
Joel: is a massive Ed sheeran fan  Richard: guesses Perfect Me: shocked😲 Español Joel: ama a Ed sheeran Richard: adivina Perfect Yo: en shock😲 Erick y Zab sentaditos😂 crushed it!😍❤🔥
La cara de Erick viendo a Chris bailar jaja ....me representa
NADIE VA A HABLAR DE LA EMOCIÓN QUE LE METE CHRIS A LAS CANCIONES.  SON UNOS BEBES ESTAN CHIQUITOS HAY QUE CUIDARLOS .....
mis bebés (cnco) tarareando una rolita de mis otros bebés (1d) me encuentro muerta😞🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I really want CNCO and BTS to like make a song together or an interview. I love both groups so much 😍
JOEL siendo fan de ED Shreraan y Justin Beiber AMO
"Me encantaron, tienen buen oído porque creo que solo logré adivinar una 😂😂😂Chris, Joel y Richard fueron los que más cantaron. Erick 👀y Zabdiel estaba bien serio 🤔😍❤️"
it's chris being the 5-year-old cute boy for me
4:14 Yo escuchando una canción  de CNCO  ¡CNCO BABY!
"Joel pero cómo es posible que no adivinaras ""Perfect"" de Ed Sheeran pero ni te preocupes yo tampoco lo hice con ""story of my life"" de One Direction así que somos la decepción😞"
"I love how Chris was so into all of the songs, especially in the Doja Cat song when he just started doing some dance from TikTok, I died 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️🙏 I love him so much 🥺💕"
"Vi ""BTS"" en el subtítulo y vine corriendo XD"
Identificaron todas las canciones pero no se sabian la letra de ninguna jajajajajaja Dios los amo 🤣🤣🤣
"Cómo Army y CNCOwner NECESITO UNA COLABORACIÓN ! Y LA NECESITO AHORA , PTM SERIA UN HIT Y QUEDARÍA EN LA HISTORIA DE LA MUSICA"
se nota que le afecto la cuarentena a chris y los trend de tik tok
Reproduzcan Hero que es la que más necesita apoyo
"JOEL PIMENTEL tiene algo que me obseciona tanto, algo especial, me hes imposible dejar de verlo😍"
I'm just laughing the whole time because they don't know most of the lyrics but they are still cute tho. 😄
"Chris me representa al momento de mirar a Joel con la misma emocion, estoy in love"
Debo decir que quede muerta cuando Chris y Joel cantaron la canción de 5sos morí mi dos grupos cnco y 5sos son lo mejor
"The way Zabdiel is just there, vibing"
"No puedo dejar de verlos :v xD  Pero CNCOwners si andan por aquí pasen por HERO, MOLPT, TAN ENAMORADOS, BESO y HONEY BOO :)"
I was freaking out when CNCO was singing dynamite from BTS. Please I want them to do something together I love them 😍
Joel demostrando ser del lane de Ed Sheraan lo amo
"Me encanta ver a Joel más cómodo en las entrevistas, el bebo me enorgullece mucho 🤧💕"
CNCO SINGING BTS OMG 👀👀
"Sin palabras, sin duda hacen mis días grises en los mejores, los amo mucho, son mi vida, en pocas palabras mi TODO. ESPERO ALGÚN DÍA CONOCERLOS ah por último........ JOEL PIMENTEL DE LEÓN CÁSATE CONMIGO xd."
"Hasta sus na na na na na * son perfectos jajaja, me encantan"
"Ellos cantan igual que yo, no me se la letra pero lo hago con sentimiento xD"
I love how Chris is getting better with these games & Erick is sitting clueless 😂❤
Chris en todo el video: na na na na nara na nara (murmura lo que se acuerda) na na na na (canta con sentimiento) na na na na na  Y eso se repite en cada canción jaja lo amo Aparte su trend de Tik Tok re tierno
"Joel cantando baby de justin beiber con tanta emocion, magic"
*CNCO están muy elegantes con esos outfits* _Los amoooo_ 💙
i love how christopher was just basically only humming to the songs he knew cause he didnt know any of the lyrics😂
They are actually so much better at melodies for real. They didn't remember any lyrics 😂😂
Me encanta como zabdiel no participó en nada jsjsjs
"Ya calmensé esta dinamica es para lxs CNCOwners es contenido para nosotrxs! Nadie lxs manda a meterse en un lugar donde no lxs han llamado :v si los chicos no les caen bien o no les agradan pues denle click a otro video que no sea de CNCO y ya :v  Asunto areglado, bay :v"
*No me se ninguna canción :D pero solo parecía mensa mirando a los poderosisimos ahr*
"Hagan lo que hagan los amo ❤️, but Joel Chris y Rich salvaron el Challenge 😂"
"me encanta como Chris le mete sentimiento I love the attitude of each ajajjajaja, good interview"
"Tan bellos todos, Chris se ve tan tierno y feliz, me encanta la sonrisa de Erick, Joel canta super bello, Richard precioso al igual que Zabdi no saben cuanto los amooo, me traen buenas vibras sigan así (emoji de corazón) jsjs"
Zabdiel solo existiendo en este video JAJAJAJA y aún así la vibra que transmite it's so cool😎 el boricua chillin'🤣🤪 estos locos son únicos y muy talentosos🤍😌
"Me, a 5sos, BTS, 1D, and CNCO stan: *happiness noises*     LOS AMOOOOO"
"First time: CNCO does not recognize the 5sos song  Second time: CNCO recognizes the song, and the artist    Come on Seventeen, I'm sure the third time is the charm and they will be able to sing it in full 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳"
Yo estoy igual que Erick que no adivine ni una sola canción 😆😆😆
I'm going to learn spanish because of them Bye🕳🚶‍♀️
CNCO singing Story Of My Life😭😍
CNCO son mis favoritos siempre.  Chris eres un amor. Me encanta tu espontaneidad....bueno todo tú.
the way zabdiel looks confused the entire time is literally me
I'm fan of 5SOS and CNCO so you Can imagine how loud I was screaming when Youngblood came 😅
"Ver a mis bellos CNCO cantar una canción de mis Babys de BTS me dio mil años de vida, Dios gracias, esto es lo que necesitaba ♡"
"Díganme qué no soy la única que amó que hasta bailaran Dynamite, AGHH LOS AMÉ"
"CNCO singing songs of 5SOS, 1D and BTS, I want to cry.   Armys and CNCOwners stop the hatred, the conflict that took place was years ago, both are very talented and different boybands. It was all a confusion, if they only come to give hate, do not come.Please stop now"
Jaja son Únicos mis Ídolos CNCO
Vieron que cnco cantó la canción de bts y ellos no insultan a bts ni el idioma coreano. Cnco realmente que nos gusto mucho la música de BTS.  Por favor armys dejen de crear rivalidades y tirar hate a los integrantes. 😊❤✌
I need them to make a cover of Señorita 😻
*1:50** Cristopher haciendo el paso de Jungkook en Dynamite! MORI! yo sé que Cris es Jungkook biased ya que incluso tiene a Cooky (el peluche de conejito que representa a JK) definitivamente Cris admira a JK! AMO!*
"I love how Chris was so into all of the songs, especially in the Doja Cat song when he just started doing some dance from TikTok, I died 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️🙏 I love him so much 🥺💕"
chris singing perfect to joel -->> 😭
CNCO LA MEJOR BAYS BANDA LATINA DIGAN LO QUE DIGAN
Jaja zabdiel y Erick no se sabían ninguna
"En toda la entrevista los más emocionados eran Joel, Christopher  y Richard jsjsj"
Zabdiel reconociendo a One direction es todo lo que esta bien en el mundo
"Siempre amo el hecho de que conocen tan bien sus voces y se conocen tan bien entre ellos, que armonizan sin haber ensayado y suena angelical 💜 respect"
_cnco cantando en inglés es ARTE_ ✨   Díganme que alguien más necesita algún remix de blingding lighs con cnco😔✌️
"2:53 Virgato Ultimamente han estado activos, soy la unica que se emociona al verlos juntos? 😭💗😂"
"*Mi inglés no está tan malo ahre, les entendí un poquito aunque solo me quedé mirandolos :D*"
My only question is how can Owen jump so high
"As much as Owen claims he's not into dancing, he's so tall absolutely everything he does looks graceful! Still the king."
owen and sav are THE power duo
the little twirl jump he did HELP ME
"I think this is, almost, everyone's favorite song"
I love how everyone’s laughing at Alex’s scenes😂❤️
Was the ‘making me blush☺️’ even planned?😂 it looks like he just did it for fun and now they put it in the show
4:47 Owen- “IMMA STARFISH”
"Parts of the last take is the final one that made it into the show. The hair flip and the ""making me blush"" motion. 😂❤️ Love this whole scene and Alex!! ❤️❤️"
“Avengers Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover of all time”  Have you heard of Alex Mercer and Dirty Candi?
the fact that owen and savannah have acted together before just makes their chemistry while dancing so much better
Alex x Dirty Candy =✨iconcic✨
I CAN JUST HEAR THE “MAKIN ME BLUSH”
THE SPIN THE SECOND TIME BEFORE THE JUMP AHAHAHAH
Im just gonna mentally keep thinking that I was in this number dancing this fun little dance
owen looks so proud 🥺 like a golden retriever
"Just so everyone knows the (rest of the) DC cast:  Orange: Halle Gall Pink: Savannah May Purple: Tori Caro Teal: Kyra Leroux Yellow: Sofia Khachi  and, of course, Denim: Owen something, I dunno if he's fully listed on IMDB but you can check 👍"
"""All Eyes On Me Full Out."" Me: Yeah, Owen working those dance moves and sass snapping ""Full Out"". 😂 Thanks for all the content, Paul! 😊♥️"
I love that we get to see the take where owen messes with sav's 'hair'!
The dislikes r from Julie Luke and Reggie bc Alex was dancing with Carrie (Julies rival) lol
i think he means all eyes on alex👀
owen and alex are absolute icons
arc and buttercup look different here😂😂
Paul is ending 2020 and starting 2021 the right way 💪🏼 JATP New Years Partyyyyyy
i loved how owen was like “make me blush”
Savannah really gave us everything! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
WHEN I GROW UP I WANNA BE ME BE ME          Me= I wanna be Savannah Lee May
THE CONTENT EVERYONE NEEDED 😌God bless your soul Paul 🙏🏾❤️
“Making me blush ☺️”
"This scene is amazing! I love this song and all the performances (Dirty Candy and Owen's). I just need a 2nd season, I need more JATP in my life!"
Owen BODIED that! that was so fun to watch  they all did amazing
Tori's smile😭😍💜
Thank you so much for the jatp content that we didn’t know we needed 😁😊
not me learning the dance that alex does
We love our dancing queens (young and sweet only 17)
"All eyes on me,  awesome. Work it Owen (Alex)."
i can’t stop smiling i love owen and savannah so much 🥺
this is what’s getting me through not having a season two right now 😌😌
Owen's having a bit too much fun
3 minutes late so I missed the live chat 😭😭😭 But hey I still get all these awesome bts vids thx Paul I loved this and all the others
“Makin me blush” so cuteee
"So good! Love everything about this. And Paul’s laughs when Owen changes it up, priceless! 💜"
Shout out to the dirty candy dancers... literally did this dance sequence over and over and didn’t look like they were even breaking a sweat!
YES! JATP content in the end of 2020 and at the beginning of 2021 too😍
I LOVE TORI SM OMG
His hair flip is everything
so the make me blush scene was Owen's improvisation???? i just love that man
Owen in this scene is my reason for living
I just can't stop looking at Owen and everything he does
Paul I love this show so much great job everyone
It's satisfying to see Carrie and Dirty Candy acknowledge Alex's presence at the end 🤣
New favorite bts video...love this song and choreo. I'm exhausted for them!
did he just post something for next month  thank you paul 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
“He’s touching his hair. 🙄“   😂😂
Owen's sass gives me life 😂
Me waiting for “making me blush☺️”
"Savannah, Tori, and Owen, as well as the other dancers, all killed this! One of my favorite scenes from the show and one of my fav songs. Savannah just does Carrie so well"
Thank you very much for this video-safe. You are very talented and so is Mr. Ortega.
owens face changed so fast when they said cut i cant 🤣
Not me waking up early to catch this premiere 😅❤️... Ty for the content Paul !!
"I'm here cracking up.  I can only help but wonder how they were able to do this without laughing, even once, lol."

Love Dirty Candy + Alex dancing!! We need more of this in  season 2 hahahahaha Thank you Paul!!

Owen ❤️😂 5:11 sooo cuteeee
am I the only one who learned this dance during winter break...
this is so good
"As much as everyone’s complimenting Owen here, and ofc he did great but honestly Savannah and the whole dirty candy group need more appreciation because these dance steps are actually really difficult and imagine doing the dance so many times to get the right shot! I mean ofc Owen did great too but everyone just comments about Owen and not the rest of the people"
Love savannah may 😍😘😘👏
I love julie and the phantoms ❤️❤️❤️❤️
*Julie and the phantoms cast just says a word* Paul Becker channel: oOoh tHiS WiLl bE gOod 📸 *sNap sNap*

Gdfsjt
Good
So interesting
Jin then: I don't understand what he said but lets laugh Jin now: I couldn't hear what they said but they laughed
"""No it's alright. If we fail, we fail."" ""We can make it.""  Kim Seokjin, I never believe there is someone out there who is 'perfect' not until I knew about you. More than your stunning visual, your heart, attitude, mindset and how you deal with others amazes me every time.  You deserve the world. Protect this guy at all cost, please."
Jin: you can’t go wrong with this Hobi: it’s all thanks to you Jin: it’s thanks to your direction  They’re so humble 🥺
8:28 _ *Yoongi adds exact portion of beef* *Jin: We need to add more. They will eat a lot later* *Best hyungs indeed* 💜
"The biggest round of applause should be for Jin and Yoongi who didn't get frustrated , both worked hard and didn't lose hope till the end . They both were fantastic .  YOONGI -JIN Saranghae 🥰"
jins laugh will never get old 😭😭😭🤣
Jin never lose hope     love him.   And v is so calm
I remember when BTS said Taehyung has a great memory in memorizing dance steps. In this video he quickly memorized the procedures. Now I believed them 😂💜
V and J-Hope’s attitude towards giving instructions was so different. V being calm and Hobi getting frustrated.
Jungkook’s “Rrrrrap monster”is back🥰  Edit:thank you for the likes😘
V maybe didnt know much about cooking but he's good in giving directions.
"1:43 Jungkook back with his ""rrrrrap monster"" I guess he will never forget that grandfather in his life 💜"
Jin's calm nature throughout! He's the best
The way Suga and Jin did 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️ in the most cute way💜💜
V must need a calm partner like him he is soo calm but j hope was also great at his work and make us laugh
Why no one's talking about suga. He did a great job eventhough he is tired 💜💜💜💜💜
"Tae : *breathes* Jimin : ""My bestie is so funny.""  VMIN ARE SO CUTE."
"Taehyung is so calm and collected, it's just so attractive."
Who wants to get Jin and Suga as their chef if possible  👇
Jin and Yoongi are so chill. Like I could never. I would’ve yelled back
Taehyungs plating skills. Gordon Ramsay could neverrr xD
V is looking so ethereal
"1:45 Jungkook imitating old grandpa never gets old 😂😂😂. _""ICONIC FOREVER""_"
Literally Tae went from Eating Bread and Jam  to Giving directions to Jin and suga🥰🥰🥰
"jungkookie will never let the grandfather rest, he really does have a special place in Jungkook’s Heart ♥️ 1:44"
"31:18 Who's cuter, the tomato placed on top of the quesadilla or Chef Jin who placed the tomato on the quesadilla (at the suggestion from Taehyung) hehe"
"JK: Hyung, I want a lot of cheese. he said that with a bunny face. this baby will forever be Bangtan's baby boy."
"Taehyung & Hobi opening their ears for Yoongi & Jin’s suggestion is so funny 6:09, 12:35 😂"
5:24 Jhope: *how do we add??* V: *um...I didn't see the kimchi* 😂  14:25 V: *then we should turn of the heat?*  Why V is so innocent??😵😂
Taehyung is the king of plating! ^^
"Jin is indeed the best person, Never give up attitude and also very supportive ! He is damn cute"
"RM: what's the difference between bread flour and multi-purpose flour?  Jimin: *explains the difference* *RM: (in his heart)Wow. I learn more about flour today thanks to you.*  Jimin: *smiled*  (in his heart): ""I'm proud of myself.*"
I really thought that V and Jhope will win but they didn't😂😆
Taehyung is way too adorable in this episode...  ☺☺☺☺☺☺
my two sunshines are too serious yet still funny. Vhope💜💜💜
Tae telling them to take the chillies out since he can't handle spice.....WHY IS HE SO CUTE??
Suga : Are we being too serious 🤔🤨??? Hobi : No you're funny enough. Smile 😊😁 Jin : 😁😁😀😆😂🤣🤩
God just give me 1% of Jin nd Yoongi's patience
Jin and Yoongi proved why they are Hyungs.....  They were so calm and listen to the maknaes.....  They were so good
Hats off to jin and yoongi 💜. They worked really hard not only once but twice. They are awesome 😇
Jin and Yoongi in the thumbnail♥ thats it thats the comment😗
Jimin and jk:hyper and chaos V and hobi:calm and concentrated
18:36 LOL  JIN being _TOO TOO TOO_ CUTE for my *hearteu* 🥺
*5:06** I can't understand why JIn is doing a hand sign when infact he can be heard through his mic* 😂
V
Jin never giving up and being calm.
"KIM SEOKJIN.. the boyfriend I want, the boyfriend I'll never get"
14:34 I have to say that JIN is Soo JINtelligent and smart. Also suga is so amazing. He did a great job.
"Jin is the best big brother, the ""kids"" are so lucky to have him! He was so encouraging and he never gave up all while still being entertaining for army! I purple him!"
Wow.... Jin really inspires me.. He wasn't ready to give up till the end... Even tho he knew they won't be able to finish in time he kept working.. 😍😍 Also.. Jin and suga are really cute and awsome older brothers😘😘
Taehyung you are truly a angel ...I love you forever ....I promise you I stan you whole my life .... Saranghaeyo tae tae💜💜
"32:33 jk imitating Jin  ""so good"" is cutest 😍"
"24:44 Jin and Suga's fighting spirit saying ""*We can do this!*"" in the cutest way definitely made my night. Indeed, cutest chefs ever."
When rolling a dough you should rub flour in the rolling pin so it doesn't stick on the dough. They did well. Avatar Jin and Suga 💕
Taehyung so cute.... Sometimes I think v is the maknae of bts.
"32:31 I keep on repeating this part when Jin adorably expressing how the quesadilla tastes so good. And 32:33 when Jungkook imitating him in a very cute voice, will never get old. I just died with these two."
Not only army's even bts remember their own memes Jk's rrrrrrap monster  And jimin's lachimolala
Jin and Suga are such an amazing pair. Typical example of different but complimentary personality of friends. Stay blessed
Vshii why are u so cute..
Taehyung told to find the most unique and prettiest plates Me: having flashbacks of his creative plating😂🤣
Jin: *We should make a lot. Add a little more. They ate a lot earlier* Bangtan really has the best hyung and we ARMYs are so lucky to have Jin. #JinnieBestHyung
Jin and suga did fantastic job they are so calm...
Taehyung India bts 😍
Jin saying he doesn't know to work with dough but then talked about making noodles like he does it every day . Our Seokjinnie is so humble.💜💜
"32:32 😂🥰  Jin: ""Hmm So good"" (in cute-soft way)  Then Jk imitates him 😂💜  Jk:""hMm sO goOd"" (in cute way!😅💜)   I really love this duo❤"
"35:10 *""Jhope is shouting""* *Well, it's not Jhope if he doesn't scream* 😂😂"
18:47 I missed that kind of laughing
Jin and Suga the 2 best cook in the team! 😍💜
Jin and Yoongi was really tired but they did their part really well 💜💜
"jin attitude never give up until the end 😍  .but i want to jump there make the noodle, yoongi add too much water lol"
At this point..only Jin can save the situation :-)
18:33 LMAO Jin
"Our poor baby taetae lost hope at the end, he just keeps on looking down? You did a good job giving directions taetae and hobi too 💜"
I became an army because of V. I stayed because of jin. And love them all..OT7
Jimin and RM are thinking how to save jin and suga from hobi after they came out😂😂
Awww I really love how Taehyung is so calm and collective!! He was explaining so slowly and calmly step by step and his deep voice he is so attractive 💜
Now I understand why namjoon need jin beside him when he is nervous. Jin is so calm and supporting. Never gives up easily.
I love Jin and Yoongi I love all 🥺😍💜
Taehyung is so calm.. i like :)
Jungkook rap monsterrr is a mood maker and will be iconic always...  Haha cute though🤣💜
If only my memory is as good as Taehyung’s 🤣
A round of APPLAUSE for Jin nd Yoongi's patience👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
"Jin has always been like that.  ""Hyung will do it"".   He has big shoulders and an even bigger heart. He has always been an easy going person. A mood maker.   Despite being talented (like bruh) he feels insecure quite often. But he makes sure that it doesn't affect the people around him. And he puts in a lot of effort to overcome them. He might not know this but he is a fighter. It's very rarely that he shows his vulnerability. It's not that he doesn't have such emotions. It's that he doesn't let it affect him too much. I am not saying that showing your vulnerability is bad. But Jin is someone who likes to keep it to himself. But I hope he vents it out to someone he trusts.   He is someone who tries to live happily. And also make people around him smile. Remember what he said in Bon voyage? ""Use me for your happiness"". He lives up to his words. Respect."
So much respect for Jin and Yoongi they did so much!
I'm wondering how both jin and suga where clam from start to the end of  both the ep. Even they were supporting the members and caring for them even in the frustrating situation.The best hyungs of BTS
32:33 jungkook teasing Jin 😂
Taehyung is so calm in this episode ♡
Seokjin - you are definition of perfect. You are the best hyung ever.
The way V looked at his hand after high-fiving J-Hope💀lmao
And jimin was able to give the ending “Runnnn” with feelings.😁
"Yoonjin : Funniest , Genius, Hardworking Duo"
Jin is so cute in here i wonder how he would look like if hi is cooking in my kitchen hehehe
Jimin was proud after teaching rm😂
"Taehyung is soo attractive,,,😍😍"
Jin and Suga ...Well Done...
My fav duo yoonjin 😂❤💜....love them🤩  P.s.- my bias Jinnie is looking so ethereal 💎💫💫
31:31 What IS Jin looking at?! He looks genuinely shook lol
Jin is the best person. I love him so much!!
5:24  Hobi : How much kimchi do we add???  V : Um.....  I didnt see the kimchi 😀😁😂🤣
jin's positivity always got me.....he's mindset and attitude made me fall inlove with him.....the more i dig in on him the more i admire him.....
Popular Opinion: Everyone wishes this was longer
"Honestly, Jungkook sounds sooo amazing. I really want to hear a song like this from JK."
"Imagine if JK with his long hair, ripped jeans and short t-shirt (exposing his tatoo) singing this kind of song at their concert"
Who's been a fan of bts for over a year now?  😌❤️
jungkook vocals are giving me feelings i didn’t know i could have
True Fact: Everyone who listen to This song is getting Better
omg jungkooks vocals-
Everyone repeat after me:  ROCKSTAR JUNGKOOK !!
Well who's coming with me into the jungle?
Jungkook snapped with those rock vocals. This man can literally do any genre and with ease 🔥
I hope they make a full ver
The line “In the city of lights”  just hits differently 😌
*Its for a Coca-Cola ad.* If you didn’t know   ‌ ‌It is originally by X ‘Ambassadors’ (https://youtu.be/aqXW57WM9TA) BTS covered it for the Coca-Cola ad.
This would definitely go straight to my playlist if they actually release the official track
Jimin high harmonies. Yeah. that’s what girls want.
This just proves how versatile Jungkook's voice is. The man is insanely talented!!
"I'm pregnant. Jungkook, take responsibility"
"So this is jk voice when he doesnt release his breathy soft voice, this is full voice with a belting, jk barely do this kind of style"
Jungkook's rock. Amazing vocalist he is.
jungkook can seriously literally do anything it's kinda scary!
"""Won't you follow me into the jungle.  Into the jun- HIDUPKAN SEMANGATMU DENGAN COKE A-"" . bruh...that scared me"
Why is no one talking about those freaking high notes of Jimin?!
Jungkook's vocals are a treasure. He's be able to digest all genres :(
jungkook : breathe  army : okay this is jungkook
"jungkook with his tattoos and blonde hair performing this, bye I'm evaporating already"
Jungkook should just sing in English from now on !! his pronunciation is perfect !!
Jungkook!!! Oh my god
i desperately want the complete cover of this song by jungkook
Sexiest man with sexiest voice!!! Damn it JK😰
This is totally jungkook's voice style OMGGG 🤤🤤🤤❤️
*JEON JUNGKOOK VOCAL KING*
The rock n roll vibe really suits jungkook
YOUR TELLING ME THIS MASTERPICE IS JUST 58 SECONDS?!
Jungkook's voice is fire ...
This song was made for JK -
"I need bts to sing some rock (the original song is rock), Jungkook has the high voice perfect for it"
Jungkook's vocal is so versatile and amazing. In Awe.
Rockstar jungkook ❤️😉
"Ok, everyone was amazing, but Jungkook’s tone in gave me goosebumps"
Wow wow wow ❤️❤️ Jungkooks rockstar vocals tho omg I'm in love 😘
i demand a full version 🥺
Popular opinion : Everyone who listen This vocal getting heal!
Jungkook was made for this song!!!
IF THEY DONT RELEASE A FULL VERSION
MANIFESTING ROCKSTAR JUNGKOOK.
OMG Jungkook 😍
when you so hurry and don't know what to write
JIN is part    Jin piece is too short  Did it seem like that to me? 😕?😕?😕?😕?😕?😕?😕?😕??
JUNGKOOK 🔥🔥🔥
Jk can totally wing it live with a guitar.. god how lucky that would be to see
"They were all amazing!!! Loved ALL of their vocals. Suited them ALL in my opinion. They really were all sitting on different notes and it blended so well. Jin , Jimin , V , Jungkook = Blessing to the ears. Still wish Rap Line had some part of it though. Even though this is for the ad I still want to hear it live"
Damn jk starting the song 🔥
"us to coca cola don’t be shy, give us the full version."
omg jin's vocals-
Kookie🐰
I lost my mind in jungkooks voice
Can I talk about how a part of V in this song sounded like Jungkook? Idk maybe it's just me
Literal a Jungkook le queda genial este estilo de música 😌💜💜 Necesito un cover completoooo🙇
"this is just great, i feel like i'm in an action movie while listening to it 😭😭"
The versatility of this man’s voice is impeccable!!  he literally does every genre justice  😤😤
"I think ""Vs"" part ist also JK singing before any shippers come and say omg Taekook always sounds the same I know I know. just listened with headphones and its the same voice as in the beginning"
Jungkook : neon lights Me : *more like JEON LIGHTS* *inserts windshield wiper laugh*
"Opinión popular: Jk lo hizo excelente Yo: estoy totalmente de acuerdo, pero mi parte favorita son los milisegundos de su dúo con jimin 💖😔✌️"
JUNGKOOK CAN LITERALLY SING ANY GENRE OR STYLE AND OWNS IT! HE'S SO BRILLIANT; THE BEST VOCALIST!
Amazing voice 😭♥️✨
I wish I could tell Jungkook how beautiful his voice is. In conclusion BTS has the best vocal line ever
Junkook’s rock n roll vibes are all that we needed
I lost my mind when I heard his rock voice.
If they don’t release a song like this in the future imma be hella mad
Okay this is made for jk. His voice is made for this
I love how all of them have their own style but Jungkook definitely showed his vocal genius here
"This concept fits kookie soo well Like this rough tuned song in English With long hair jungkook With tattoos, DAMN honeyyyyy BOI IS HOT"
Rock stars BTS
"Jungkook's voice makes this ad mind blowing, also I loved how Jin perfectly pulled off his lines! His voice was amazing"
Thank you Coca Cola for showing me this song😭🖤 Jungkook is killing me even moreeeeee
Is no one gonna talk about taehyung's line here ? His vocals gave me goosebumps
jungkookie really lives for this beat. wish it was longer we all.
we can all agree that jk’s voice really suits this style and that we need more!!!
I'm in luv with them all and always
"Jungle, desert, hell, my own demise, hun I’d follow y’all anywhere"
"the ""tie me up"" in the background BSKWHSJABA"
Come on guys not only Jungkook but the wholeVocal line is amazing......
"Vocal line, awesome !! Jk, amazing !! BTS, bless !!"
THEY SHOULD’VE SAVED THIS FOR A SOOOOONGGGG😭😭😭😭😭😭
This song is too amazing for a commercial
"Blonde long hair, a hand full of tattoos, all black outfit JK singing this.  I am simping over this vision. I didn't know jk singing like this would made me feel something that I didn't know existed in me"
"omg if they cover ""Believer "" of Imagine Dragons , i think it wil be very good :333"
I absolutely REFUSE they went this hard to not make it a full song 🥺🥺
Can we appreciate how BTS always do these ads together not solo
we need an era like this cause it fits jk and tae so well
Jungkook's vocals r refreshing ❤️
*WHY HAVE I FIRST DISCORVERED THIS NOW*
Jungkook's voice is killing me
I was searching the Jungle for Jin's lines...
Am I the only intellectual who searched this is Spotify 😌💜
JUNGKOOK I-
"Just imagine, Jungkook is singing this song at the awards ceremony with his long hair, tattoos, leather pants and electronic guitar. I'm sure everyone would be shocked"
I just wanna Hear more songs like this from Jungkook it really suits him
jungkooks voice hits differently
The healing power of jungkook voice😃😃😃😴😴  # borahae💜 bts

Also, Mr. Worldwide Handsome! Min Yoongi Yoongi, you are always so calm, and quiet. You also show determination to finish anything you are doing. Yoongi, you inspire me to be calmer and focused. Jung Hoseok Hoseok, our sunshine, and our everything. You always are in such a good mood every day, even if your day went bad. Hoseok, you inspire me to smile often. Park Jimin Jimin, my angel, and my everything, you were the one who brought me into this beautiful fandom. You continue to help others, even if they anger you. You don’t need abs to be perfect. Jimin, you inspire me to love others. Kim Taehyung Our Gucci and goofy boy, you used to be a poor boy, but with you hardworking skills, you have the riches, but yet you still didn’t let fame ruin you. Taehyung, you inspire me to be determined Jeon Jungkook You work really hard each day, as the maknae, you get teased, but you still don’t let it stop you. You working hard makes me want to stand up and do something too. Jungkook, you inspire me to work harder. A.R.M.Y You all comfort BTS as much as you can.

Advice to people who are new to bts:  If you see two members fighting.  There is a 90% chance its Jin and Jungkook.
It’s funny how Jin is in almost every clip 😂

3:51 I'm coming back again for this 😂 😂
Dumb and dumber is the official title of Jinkook duo.... 🤣 They share half a braincell with each other... and even that doesnt work half the time.
I love that they don't take themselves too seriously all the time and are able to make each other laugh! They really have fun together and genuinely enjoy each other's company. This is one of the reasons that made me become an ARMY!
mostly the vocal line with namjoon and hobi sometimes joining in the fun as yoongi ignores them or laughs lol
OMG JIN PRETENDING TO BE A WITCH. I cant stop replying it😂😂
Jin is also world wide funny guy..😂😂😂🧑
Jin is always a making chaos lmao
This video was all about JinKook's bickering moments😁

Jin is funny.i like him.he like to tease others especially jk
2:04 the music 😭😭😭😭 pls i want the name of it 😂
Idk y but I think baby laughing sounds really suits jimin💜
"When I first heard BTS, I was like yeah...they’re bunch of good looking musicians, but when I started stanning them if anyone would ask... am like they’re all crackheads 😅 still good lookin and artistic tho!"
They NEED to be PROTECTED like not many groups are like this 🧸🦋
its always jin and jungkook 😂😂😂😂😂
Si jimin siempre apoyando y defendiendo a sus amigos lo amamos gente no hay que ser así con j hope
"_no entiendo porqué la gente le esta tirando tanto hate a Jimin y J-hope, ambos son muy talentosos en todo, especialmente en sus bailes y en su grupo, un solecito y un angelito. Sabemos que ARMY estará alli para siempre con ellos apoyando.♡ se le ama a bts mucho// ojala esos insultos hacia ellos paren_"
Creo que todos deben ser tratados por igual hobi es realmente hermoso y no deve ser tratado Haci ni los otros chicos
"Ay que hermoso que Jimin y Hobi sean asi con los demás integrantes! Definitivamente BTS es familia, son muy unidos 💜😍"
Ellos siempre se cuidan y se apoyan entre si...BTS son una familia✨💜
"El bailarín también empujó a Jimin minutos antes de que el solecito se le enfrentara. Es más Hobi estaba molesto por la forma como trató a Jimin y pues como estaba con la sangre en el ojo,  le dió  unas clasesitas de baile sarcástico y brillante. Mi bb es tremendo bailarín al igual que Jimin el cual estaba nervioso, lo mismo le pasó a Jungkook, simplemente estaban algo asustados. Pero obviamente Hobi tiene barrio...JHOOOOOPEEEE I love you solecito."
"Pobre de mi Namjoon :( si el traductor esta ahí tiene que hacer bien su trabajó, espero que Nam no se estrese tanto:( que buen gesto de parte de Hobi 🥺💜✨"
Que lindo de Jimin al igual que Army siempre vamos a estar defendiendo a los chicos a🥺💜✨
When llegas temprano y no sabes que comentar:  _El panadero con el pan_
Por eso es que los amo por qué defienden a los demás
Siii Jimin y hobi son muy dulces ayudan a todos sus amigos no hay nadie que pueda ser como Hobi y Jimin😊😊
Nuevo miedo desbloqueado: que Jimin se enoje conmigo :(
Jimin siempre es tan adorable y siempre apoyando a sus amigos lo amo
por eso amo a estos niños tenemos tanto que aprender de ellos.te amo mi jimin y a todos los de la banda de bts..
Jimin es muy dulce pero la carita qué pone cuándo se enoja cuidado igual yo también haría lo mismo si veo que le hacen mal a las personas que amo 💜 y bts son familia y se quieren mucho💓
Army protegiendo a Todo Bts con Capa y espada
Hola bueno armys como ya sabrán hoy en Twitter los haters hicieron tendencias diciéndole a jimin putita por favor vayan a denunciar las cuentas 😭😭😭
No olvidemos cuando en la misma competencia de baile el bailarín contrario empujó a jimin y j hope dijo que en ese momento le hirvio la sangre
1:06 no supero la cara de Jimin
Llegue de una vi este tema. Jimin se lo ve hermoso cuando esta molesto
Aaawww jimin y hobi por eso los amo tanto y los admiro por su esfuerzo 😔💜💜💜😔
Por está razón siempre digo que si falta uno de los muchachos de BTS....ellos mismo no aguantarian la ausencia...DLB. 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"aWw 🥺✋🏼💜✨ Amo que se defiendan entre ellos 👉🏼👈🏼 son más que compañeros, son una hermosa familia 🤧👌🏼💕 y las Armys somos sus esposas jajsja 💜✨💕  Son tan tiernos!🐭🤙🏼💕 Siempre estarán para el otro cuando lo necesiten✨💘"
"Awww Jimin siempre defendiendo a los chicos también entre ellos, me molesta que no los tomen en serio, es un privilegio tenerlos cerca y ellos sólo juegan.."
Jimin te  quiero  mucho🥰
Jimin es un Angel no merece hate😔💔...y BTS es una hermosa familia estoy feliz de haberlos conocido. Por cierto me encantan tus videos :)💕
"Qué fue lo que le hicieron a nuestro queridísimo J-Hope 👿   Qué lindo es Jimin, siempre defendiendo y apoyando a sus compañeros ❤"
"ARMY estará presente siempre q alguien Aga Dani,comentarios ofensifos o amenasas"
nadie: yo viendo como tae llora y jung-kook comiendo :v preocupacion por favor xd
Jimin tan lindo apollando  a sus amigos nosotras las armys los apollaremos like 👇si piensas los mismos por fa
¡yah!...Hoseok da miedo cuando se enoja ya que normalmente lo vemos siempre pasifico....o algo asi xd
"Con respecto a jimin estaba concentrado por que quería que mi bello hobi ganará 💕💕💕 por que no querían perder contra el otro grupo de bailarines, ya que uno de ellos empujó a Jimin 💔😡 pero si entre mis Bangtan se cuidan como verdadera familia 💜💜💜✨"
Una de las razones de porque están BTS en mi ❤✨
Otra razón mas para amar Jimin y a todos los chicos de BTS ....we love you.
Que hermoso jimin defendiendo a sus amigos por eso lo quiero mucho ❤️
Jimin es un ángel 😍😍
Mi bebé JHOPE  es el mejor bailarín y jimin el mejor amigo ♥️como no amarlo.❤️
"BTS son una gran familia, se cuidan y protegen entre ellos💜😘💜 ... Cómo no amarlos ❤️❤️!!!"
Orgullosa de mi jiminshi es todo puro amor😍😍
Hola!!! Jimin es un Ángel 💜
"hl    primera :""D   ARMY OF THE DAY :""D"
J hope tiene un gran corazon y jimin es mi mochi uwu
Jamás dudaría de Jimin...el es todo ❤ x eso esta.. donde tiene que estar.. con sus amigos!!!!🥰🥰🥰💜💜🐣
Bts sempre foi uma linda familia eu admiro isso
"*""Y como consecuencia RM, se estaba sobre esforzando lo que causó que Namjoon se ponga algo nervioso""*  Nadien: Literalmente Nadien: *REALLY* Nadien:  Yo: **Riéndose sola como Psicópata**  Edit: Autolike para no morir ignorada"
Esta es una de las razones por las que amo a BTS😢😊
Otra razón para amar a jimin
"Jimin es muy dulce al pensar en sus compañeros  Y hobi, mi solecito igualmente 😇😇😇😇😇😇"
Jimin siempre a sido muy adorable por eso es el ángel de bangtan 💜
"Hay que tiernos :""""3 estos chicos me llenan de ternura 💜💜"
VENGO A DECIR...SE ACERCA CUMPLE DE SOLECITO ASI QUE A HACER STREAM A TODOS SUS TRABAJOS AMI...WE are OT7
"Son más que un grupo, son una familia y hace años que lo dejaron claro. Es muy lindo que se defiendan entre si, se nota la linda relación que no solo como compañeros de trabajo, tienen. Felicidades Jimin por ser un buen amigo."
Que tierno pero eso hacen las familias nunca te abandonan ni olvidan
Wey en American Hustle Life ese capitulo es excepcional. JHOPE les da con todo y les demuestra de que esta hecho.  Necesitamos mas de estas demostraciones de baile del talentoso Hoseok.
Ellos si saben que es la amistad se apoyan y defienden en cada momento 😍😉👍
JIMIN es un súper protector! Me encanta 😊
",jimin es amor  el siempre piensan en sus amigos  ,gracias jimin por apoyar a j hope los amo una army por siempre"
"Metas para Army/stream Life goes on:300m fire:200m/800m idol,fakelove,mic drop y dynamite: 1 billon es muy importante difundir🌁"
"Cierto jimin siempre defendió ,apoyo y les subió ánimos a sus amigos es lindo saber que se llavan bien"
Me gusta que Jimin se preocupe por ellos porque a fin son su familia y ARMY está ahí para apoyarlos. Los amooo ❤️
Awws Jimin siempre protegiendo a los de los suyos awws k bonito nwn💕 lindo video :D💕💕💗✨🐻✌️💗💕✨💕
Jimin es una persona muy especial así también como el j hope ☀️🥺♥️
hermoso jimin siempre apoyando asu familia
Por qué hay personas que no aprecian el gran talento que tienen estos chicos más que todo a J-HOPE por qué el tiene un gran talento y es una persona muy increíble
Tan hermoso Jimin siempre defendiendolos que gran corazón
Los 7 son personas maravillosas . La expresionas de jimin son unicas
"cosas como esta hacen que ARMY saque las garras por los chicos.. gente, hay que cuidarlos!!"
Yo aria lo mismo apoyar a mis seres k kiero mucho en especial a bts k gracias a ellos e podido saber muchas cosas el saber del esfuerzo la dedicacion y por supuesto el amor y el apoyo k se tiene k dar siempre en las buenas y las malas asi k jimin ase eso por los chicos . Buen video Uwu purple ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hello worldwide bts 💖🤗
"Esto solo hace que Ame mas a Jimin de lo que ya de por si me gustaba, es un encanto!! xDD"
Ame como JHOPE puso a trabajar al traductor para darle algo de descanso a RM obviamente le preocupa que Nam tenga tanto sobre sus hombros que quiso aliviarle el trabajo haciendo que el sr traductor hiciese lo que debía. Por eso es que Hoseok y hasta Jungkook se esfuerzan en aprender Ingles para ayudar a Namu.  Mis bebes hermosos ayudándose y siempre mostrando su talento.
Hay no mames ese puro ensaño de jimin que puto miedo va a dar
Si es cierto ami me da mucho coraje porque ami j hope porque siempre me lo andan maltratando 💜💜💜
Que yo sepa el que causa más temor cuando se molesta es J-Hope
Hobi!! ☀️ Que hermoso gesto el tuyo!! Se nota la Humildad!! ✨ Y por supuesto todos los integrantes de BTS son un ejemplo a seguir!!
Esta es una hermosa familia q se apoya unos a otros y esto es de admirar todos se protegen entre ellos y me encanta el cariño q a crecido entre ellos Hobi verdaderamente es un sol
"Jimin es el que más miedo da cuando se enoja, es cierto :^"
Mi solecito hermoso eres tan guapo y muy humilde y bb Jimin tan guapo y protector de sus guapos hermanos 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 Dios los bendiga...
No se porque le dicen cosas a jimin y hobi si Todos los integrantes son muy talentosos y muy amables aparte ellos son capases de conquistar al mundo entero con sus hermosas sonrisas❤️✨
Army dejen de hacerle caso a los antis okey? Solo nos distraen y nosotros les damos la atención que quieren
"Son pocas las personas que esta Dispuesta, defender a los demás, sin importarle las consecuencias. ES TENER   INCORPORADO EN LA PERSONA EL SENTIDO DE JUSTICIA Y PROTECCIÓN, SI ALGUIEN LO TIENE ES JIMIN, NO SOLO CON LAS PERSONAS, CON ANIMALES TAMBIÉN. PARA EL SOLO 👏👏👏👏 y que no CAMBIE NUNCA ❤🙂"
Jimin siempre tan atento con sus compañeros.......Los amooo 사랑해 방탄소년단 ❤
"Ojalá en un futuro cercano las armys quieran y valoren a los siete chicos por igual... :,c  a veces este tipo de cosas es por las que me avergüenzo de estar en este fandom."
Siempre e tenido la duda de como se comportaría bantang si un dia ellos miran como maltratan a una de sus fans en su propia cara😳
Amo a j hope
"que bonito video ,creo q una de las virtudes mas importante de nuestros BTS es q siempre respetan a los demás tanto en lo artístico como en lo personal, pero a veces se chocan con gente q creen q porq no hablan su idioma o porq simplemente les da la gana irrespetan a nuestros chicos por eso ARMY vigila cada detalle y no vamos a permitirlo luego dicen q somos agresivas pues lo seremos con aquellos q no se comporten con respeto, y si en American Hustle Life ( es una serie q pueden verla en Daily Motion lo buscan en Google) donde fue la batalla de baile ese joven q se enfrento a Jhope tuvo movimientos algo burlones, yo q no se mucho de baile y me dieron ganas de patearlo, por eso cuando fue el turno de Jimin fue muy agresivo y es logico todo tiene su limite . Creo los armys en general deberían ver esta serie es muy buena ,BTS y sus experiencias en USA cuando no eran famosos"
BANTANG ES TAN UNIDO QUE TODOS ELLOS PUEDEN CONFIAR EN LOS DEMAS MIENBROS A OJOS CERRADOS ....quisiera encontrar una amistad como esa
"No me sorprende. Los chicos han pasado por tanto juntos, sin han pasado todos estos años y no se han separado es porque se aman los unos a los otros y se apoyan... una verdadera amistad."
Ambos son geniales y a la vez causan algo de temor cuando estan molestos😁
I LOVE J-HOPE💓
Ay Jimin mi bebe por q es tan tierno 😍 es un angel 0:’)
Se cuidan entre ellos eso demuestra cuanto se quieren o mejor dicho se aman y si yo estuviera en su lugar haria lo mismo muy buen ejemplo que nos dan los chicos los amo <3
"Los amo BTS, gracias por hacer este contenido amiga"
J-hope best solcito perfecto bailante
Que hermoso qué Jimin sea así  apoyando a J-Hope él se merece todo el apoyo de las armys porque también deben de querer a J-Hope porque también es parte de BTS ♥️ amo a J-Hope
"también jimin dijo una vez que le gustaba que sus amigos  halagaran a bangtan pero que cuando hablaban mal de bts dejaba de hablarles, definitivamente ellos son una familia ya han pasado muchas cosas juntos literalmente como si fueran hermanos viviendo juntos todo el tiempo es lo que son💜amo ser army✨"
Es hermoso que se pongan a de fenderse entre ellos me canta como se apoyan como una familia..BTS es una familia que se cuidan mutuamente. los amo 🤗😘😍😉
Te amo j-hope💖💖💖💖
"Ay que lindos todos son así, cuidando uno del otro, y que bueno que nuestro solecito aprenda inglés, es mucha presión para el líder"
Que hermoso tener a unos idols igual de gruñones que las fans somos idénticos no te meta a con nosotros. Jejejej Y con alguien de nosotros jejee

"Taehyung semakin dewasa sepertinya semakin tenang dan banyak diam ya. But, i still love you 💜 Apa jangan-jangan perutnya lagi melilit?"
"1:44 sengaja aku puter terus biar Jungkook capek , bikin ngakak juga hahha"
"Tadinya aku lagi badmood, pas lihat ada notif ini lngsng senyum"" dong :)"
Aku selalu menunggu saat suga berbicara Aku sagat suka cara dia berbicara
V we love you fighting
"32:27,rm oh bakso 😂😂😂😂"
Tae tiap kali ngomong pasti ada gerakanya😍
"Di episode 122 dan 123  v terlihat tidak bersemangat , tidak ceria seperti biasanya"
"Perkara makanan mereka nomor 1, mungkin karena saat masa sulit dulu  harus berbagi makanan dan sekarang mereka benar2 menghargai itu. 💙"
maknae JK niruin kakek lagi  rrrappp monsterr 😂
Kenapa aku gemes sama jimin-suga ya wkwkw
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa thank u sub indonya😭💜
Jk say: Rrraapp mosntaa That so pretty >♡< hahaha

"Gangertii lagii sama ni channel biasanya kalo Chanel yang Nge sub indo in beginian subs nya dikitt,terus gampang kena banned yutup  Tapii nih channel uwaww makasii ya kak,, semoga chanelnya aman selaluu biar bisa liatt run BTS terus"
"Aku yg selalu telat nonton, karna koneksi yg buruk😭😭   Makasih buat admin yg selalu update terus😊Semoga sehat selalu🤗"
"태형 씨, 왜 이번에 123을 받았는지 평소처럼 밝지 않았어요 :("

Bts is like a circle of pillars that gives support to each other  Jin gives support to suga  Suga gives strength to rm to fight with harsh world  Rm gives jhope confidence to always shine like a sun Jhope teaches jimin how to be kind with everyone  Jimin teaches taehyung how to do care of everyone  Taeyhung teaches jungkook how to handle worst situations without getting hypered  Jungkook holding jin because he is the man pillar  They both fight to much but they love each other  All of them  tease each other hit each other roast each other but love each other  May god bless them  May all of you live long God please never disband them  I love all of you  These all lines are just from a 13 year old girl  Because of bts i matured a lot  Have a nice day  I will pray that you meet bts soon

"I get everything I want with just ""Mommy, Daddy please"" accurate."
Jin: I keep everyone in line..... Also jin: going crazy with the gang when money gun shoots out 😂😂💕

ARMY when they see the word shook: JUNKSHOOK
Jungkook is still a baby he is so cute!!!!
The way that Jimin and tae peaked in when it said middles made me faint a little. Good job!
Namjin mommy daddy 😂😂😂💜💜
Jin doesn't like being called a Mom we should respect what our Idols said and I know this video is a joke but don't call him mom or eomma
Yes when jungkook walks in the room all the attention goes to him But is it weird that jin is momy
When you realize Namjoon is actually the middle in the group 😳😂
Where is our cat 🙄  I mean where is Suga
THE BANGTON FAMILY 😂
Well I am the youngest in my family and with my cousins I am the middle one so I act good in the middle and youngest one lol
I am the youngest in the family and with my cousins i am bigger than them
Reaction of Namjoon  and Seokjin to that they are mom and dad : Namjoon: Ohh so cute 😊😊 Seokjin : Why did they change my gender and I am too young to be a mom   😁😁😁
"no one : Jungkookie : ""I get everything with just a *MOMMY DADDY PLEASE* 😂"
The last jk part was true😂
Jk's one is so true tho😂😂😂💜
"The king of gucci taehyung for ""hand me down"" 😂😂😂😂"
"""You hate us cuz you ain't but trust us it's the truth"" bro I love this part so much."
"When its jk turns and the video music is ""i keep everything i want with just a mommy daddy pls""  The mommy is jin and the daddy is rm😂😂😂😂"
Jungkook is still a baby 🍼🍼
Junkook: finally no one can call me baby iam 100 years old!! Yass!  Armys: aww junkook baby you are so cuteeeeeee cute little baby  Jk: COME ON ARMYS IAM NOT A BABY?!
The Part where jimin n v were screaming ( run mv) Fits perfectly with the lyrics😭😎 (rules we made for us to break which leads our siblings shook)
Jin does actually act like the cool mum tho 💪🏽💜🖤💜🤍😁❤️❤️🌹😍💃🏽🥳😜

Yup Hoseok's Shoes will always shine no matter what ✨✨✨
Lil Bunny Jungkook part was on Point!💜💜💜💜💜💜💜☺.......
"I love how in the ""mommy daddy please"" part namjoon and jin were there lol"
"I especially love how at the end where it says""MOMMY DADDY PLS"" it shows jin and rm"

OMMG I DIED AT THE MOMMY DADDY PLS PART
There is no word like 'irrelavent' in bts.. we army love every single for them equally.. no body is underrated.. especially kpop king jimin and 2nd most handsome person v❤️
Jk being the pride and joy is soooo true 😁😊 and he made me happy just walking through earth
The younger sibling coming and us being irrelevant doesnt apply to our family. 😂 The attention comes to me being a teen and stuff. They worry about the stuff i could do or think hehe
Jin:hi I am the oldest Namjoom: I'm the leader of the pack. SUGA: and all my siblings just be riding off my back. Jin: I'm basically the parent I keep everyone in line I've NEVER had a hand down and my shoes always shine. Jimin and tae:hi we are the middles and we are always overlooked & rules are ment for us to break which leaves our other siblings shook hand me down are all we know there is always nothing new you hate us cuz you ain't us but trust us it's true. JKAYY:hi I am the youngest I'm my family pride and joy my siblings were irrelevant since the day that I was born I walked in the room all the attention goes  to me I get anything I want with a mommy Daddy pls
"this was so good 😭  side note tho jin has stated many times that being called mom or eomma is uncomfortable for him and he doesn’t like it. ik this is a joke and i completely get that and i wasn’t gonna comment but i saw the comments disagreeing with people who have said jin doesn’t like it or people saying that it’s just humour yes it’s humour TO YOU. but i can assure you jin probably wouldn’t find it humorous... if you’re blatantly disregarding that you might as well be saying ‘idc that jin doesn’t like it... it’s funny to me so i’ll keep calling him something that clearly makes him uncomfortable’   and yes ik that it’s just a video and the likely hood of jin seeing this is slim, but that’s not the point... the point is that videos like this whilst are funny in some aspects... if new armys see this they’ll believe that image of jin being seen as a mom... they’ll start calling him that too. basically it will get spread around"
Omfg😭😭that’s was soooo cute✨wtf😭😭😭
This legit accurate I-
🤣🤣😂
Jungkook always like me  and I like him he will still baby
"""hi I am the youngest"" Me: hello, the youngest, 🤣"
"Y'all chill this humor have some sense of humor, yea we respect our idols we would never do something to make them uncomfortable at least i won't but sometimes stuff aren't serious and just for laughs"
"Baby kookie gets everything with a mommy, daddy please aawwwww 😍🥰"
Jk💜
It suits perfectly!! They're so adorable 💜💜💜💜
With mommy daddy please 🥰
AHHHHHHH KOOKIE IS TOO CUTE 🐰🐰🐰🐰🐰🐰🐰🐇🐇🐇🐇🐇🐇🐇🐇
When the middle come out😂😂💜
Imagine BTS as a real family like Jin is the mom of the group RM the dad Suga the rich uncle that always gives 300$ to the b-day boy and then leaves ! J-hope the Fashion designer. Jimin the moms favorite. V the strawberry farmer but secretly party every night and Jungkook the baby in front of Jin but actually the *International Playboy* !!!
OMG this was so cute😍😍💜💜💜

"""Im the oldest...... the leader of the pack..... all my other siblings keep on riding on my back.......keep them in the line"" And here is me the oldest being the youngest of my siblings😂😂😂😂'young siblings mostly the leader of the pack, me riding on them and they always keep me in the line'😂😂🤣🤣🤣I'm the opposite of the song"

Jimin's undercut Tae's eyes Their see through shirts..   I'm gonna need to report their stylists for attempted murder.
V with no bangs😍😍😍💜💜💜  Kill me now .. kill me now do you hear me....🥺🥺💜💜

"1:41 This handsome man is ""killing me now! killing me now!"""
3:08 v omg so handsome ı love you
Jimin is the real life Victor Nikiforov and he's hella beautiful.  And V looks like a real life black swan.
Kim taehyung making us ready to risk it all🥵that was fire
V looks more mature and manly with forehead exposed
"kim taehyung why are you trying to kill me?? Taehyung's parents, you did a masterpiece . Thank you..."
V looking amazing no words 😘😘😘😭😭😭😭
V😍😍😍💜💜💜💘
"I've been noticing this ever since 2015, V's dancing is actually pro I mean it's just flawless. The entertainment should definitely give him a chance where he can show off the dancing along with the breath taking visuals."
V 😍😍😍😍😍😍
"Yoongis mic, Jungkooks shirt and Taes hair and eyes.. I have been murdered 🥵🥵"
I really want to see Jimin's solo Black Swan performance  THAT WAS AN SECOND MOST BEAUTIFUL BLACK SWAN PERFORMANCE AFTER 2020 MMAs
💜Taekook is looking so handsome💜

"All look so handsome (  KIM SEOK JIN,  MIN YOONGI,   KIM NAMJOON  ,JEON HOSEOK,   PARK JIMIN,  KIM TAEHYUNG, JEON JUNGKOOK )"

Namjoon and Suga sounding and looking INTENSE Jin and Hobi sounding FLAWLESS And the maknae line looking like THAT- Are we SURE we all didn't just collectively experience some sort of fever dream?
Taehyung's eyes  Taehyung's gaze That's it that's the comment.
Nobody : Tae: let's wear gloves and not tell anyone
Nadie absolutamente : Yo: enamorada de los ojos Tae

MAP OF THE SOUL 7 : ON E This ceremony was a huge shock  Because of the amount of beauty and luxury 😭😭❤️💜

"Hope you guys enjoyed the “Moffetized” version of “Dynamite”!! Please check out The Moffett Store when you have a chance! I have some new products I’ll be dropping soon!! http://www.Moffett.store 🥁 To all the BTS fans on here, follow me on Instagram and Facebook and SHARE this video! http://www.Facebook.com/jmoffettmjm and http://www.Instagram.com/jmoffettmjm ❤️"
I hope BTS realizes how absolutely honored they should be to have you do their song!
I am eager to see you playing in a BTS concert like u did with MJ. That is going to be SUPER.
You and BTS at the GRAMMYS would be amazing Just imagine their dance brake with your drum solo I WANT IT
Fun fact: I had NO idea the engineer was going to fade the song back in after the solo! I was surprised that I was still on time with the song! 😅
As an emotional BTS fan I'm in tears. This is beautiful and a huge honor.
"If this video doesn’t get more than a million views, I’m gonna be disappointed. Cuz that beat just outmatched Dynamite’s beat, for sure!!!✌🏾✌🏾"
Wen this pandemic gets over and BTS goes on tour plz. Play for them..🥺the way u played for MJ.. #respect
"I am an army and I feel proud upon watching this one. So proud of the boys as well. Thank you, Sir for acknowledging their song.💜💜💜"
BTS and Sugarfoot is the duo I didn’t know i needed.
"Oh my God, just imagine him playing with BTS in a concert it will be incredible. Congratulations on the name of BTS ARMY and in the name of Bangtan they really love this type of work 💜💜💜"
"As an Army + MJ fan, I loved this! Thank you so much! ☺️💜"
"That was so great! As a huge fan of both MJ and BTS I’m so grateful you gave us this gift, this is huge! That would have been awesome to hear it in Dynamite with dance break inspired completely by Michael Jackson performance that they did in an award ceremony last month! Hope you guys get to collaborate and Tour together I miss them I miss going to their concert and with my wholesome ARMY family, hope 2021 get better!"
The break down sounded like a New Jack Swing type beat
Wow this is huge! Hope to see you and BTS on the same stage one day 🙏
I'm crying and my feet don't stop moving
In everything Michael Jackson always be🙏👑🎶
"Thank you so much. As a fan of both Michael and BTS, this is so incredible !!💜"
It's honor to listen to your version of Dynamite----.  I still miss MJ and love BTS.  Thank you.
너무감동적이예요 ㅠㅠ💜 탄이들도 분명 우리가느끼는것 이상 감동했을거예요 💎 우리를  행복하게 해줘서 감사해요💖💜
"I've never seen nobody acknowledged that this song is in a way similar to ""I Want You Back"" specially the mere last part 4 hits, it's beautiful 😇"
감동 그자체 !!!  마이클잭슨 & 방탄소년단  그리고 그들의  음악을 듣는 우리...  고맙습니다 드럼 아저씨 ^^*
"울컥하다가 아. . . 대가의 절제된,  그러나 어찌할수없이 흘러넘치는 그루브에 감탄하고 갑니다"
울컥! 한다는 한국어를 아실까요? 드럼을 치며 분명 옛친구가 보이고 느껴졌을듯해요. 당신의 진심이 제게도 느껴져 진심 심장아래 어느부분의 울컥함이 올라 왔어요. 당신과 우리의 비티에스에게서 전해지는 예전의 그분을 오늘 새롭게 느끼며 감사함을 전합니다. 👍👍👍😭😭😭
"Another great beat to add to the ongoing list of Dynamite versions. The drums fit so well to an aready perfect track!  Thank you for this, I know BTS would be thrilled to know and MJ would be proud. Imagine a bts X mj collab."
There's just something in how you hit the hi-hat that sounds so good and is reminiscent of the History Tour. Bravo! 🔥🔥
Thank you so much for this tribute to the  boys #BTS  You've accompanied the biggest name in pop  It's an honor to hear you play on BTS's DYNAMITE
멋진 연주 감사합니다  BTS와 MJ 짱! 멀리 대한민국에서 신나게 듣고 있습니다
BTS of muffett time is like a rythm going down the river
i'm not a fan of bts personally but that drum solo and moffettization make me bang my head while listening to it
"You're a living legend Jonathan! ♡ Michael Jackson is looking down at heaven smiling at you. You're such an amazing drummer. You didn't even need a metronome, metronome needs you. Always spot on!"
This is a great honor & really beautiful.
마이클잭슨의 음악을 즐겨 들으며 자랐는데.. 영광입니다~!!!! 와우~ 드럼소리가 이렇게 절제되고 깨끗한 음색의 악기였나요👏👏👏 코로나19 얼른 사라지고~ 방탄소년단과 콜라보 기대해도 될까요~^^ BTS 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
BTS랑 같이 공연하는 날을 손꼽아 기다릴께요!!!^^
"This is so incredible 😭😭 thank you so much for doing this 😭😭 i hope you and BTS gonna have a collab soon, this is amazing 😭💜😭💜"
우와. 감사드려요. 생생한 비트가 함께해서 더 좋아요.
"Debieran de convoxar las nuevas bandas a grandes musicos como Sugar, para que sientan el ""real groove"" de por qué son tan buenos éstos musicos. Abrazo desde Argentina Sugar y BTS Army !!!💪🇦🇷❤️🇺🇸"
최고네요
"this's amazing🤯, you're so talented"
I like how on the breakdown/solo you're doing like multiple hits on the snare. That's how I also vision the drum part. Very similar to the beat on MJ's Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.
Loved it!  Would make for an amazing live colab performance with BTS especially with the MJ inspired dance break included.  I’m willing it into existence.
ahh michael jackson's drummer. THe michael jackson of all drummers.
"Wow, I AM SO IN LOVE WITH MJ'S CONCERT AND I NEVER KNEW THERE IS A LEGEND WHO PLAYS THIS, I LOVED THIS SO.MUCHHH Y'ALL"
Legend covering legends 💜🙌
We feel so honored thank you so much for that video💜💜💜💜
진짜 감사합니다..👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😍😍😍😍😍
"this is amazing, sir! thank you."
I love this! Thank you so much for this beautiful piece 💜
"I would love to see J Hope get a hold of this drum beat, and snap on a cheoregraphy dance break 🕺🏽🔥"
Wow!!!! 좋아요! 최고예요!
BTS must be feeling honored to listen to this performance and so do I.
It’s amazing! I love this!!!! It’s a great honor to listen to your version. Thank you so much!!
"I think this will mean a lot to our boys. I am so happy right now💜 Thank you Sir,really this sounds incredible!"
Love songs that let the percussion drive the song.  Excellent.
"That was very nice! Please, do a little more! It's so much exciting, you must to know. Greats to Jennifer and Lavelle!"
"Cool! This is so amazing. The emotions and passion you always pour while playing the drums, I think that's the best thing."
"Wow, wow, wow. It's so incendiary and energetic that I can't stop dancing. Big Hit Entertainment pay attention to this!!!"
"Thank you so much Sir. The improv drum solo added so much funk to it,it sounds great.  Respect🙏💜"
My feet are moving without me knowing!
"Your play showed me ""the great beauty of moderation."""
OHHH THANK YOU FOOT!!!  BTS really needs a live band after hearing what you can do! 💜
A huge honor! Thank you for your kind words about BTS's musicality and artistry! Hope they see this!! 💜💜
The way I am grooving to this! I love it! Thank you for the cover and your explanations throughout the video 💜
That's Michael's drummer. Thanks for showing.
"As an army and a fan of Michael that I used to be it's a honor to see Michael Jackson's drummer make a drum cover of Dynamite. Love it, thank you🙏🏻"
"Thank you for doing such amazing cover, Sir. It's an honor for both of BTS and Army to have you covered Dynamite. I wish someday you will meet to each other, that would make such history."
"They were going for a Michael Jackson type song, and having MJ's drummer cover the song must mean a whole lot to the boys and us, the fans. Thank you, legend!"
"This is amazing, what a big honor! Thank you so much! 💜"
"This is absolutely incredible, I can’t help but imagine how awesome it would be if u guys performed together and that awesome drum solo was used for the dance break, which was inspired by Michael Jackson dance moves so it would be an awesome connection!"
OMG!!! The drum solo groove is simple yet spectacular and it fits perfectly!!!
Thanks sir for appreciating BTS! 💜
Love it! So Funky. Of course I'm a musician so it's easy me to get in the groove!❤
"i loved this a lot, i especially appreciated your explanation in the beginning, thank you for this :)"
OMG LOVE THIS...Amazing
"I would say, it will be a great tribute to MJ ...by Mr Jonathan and BTS!!"
Legend praising legends😍What can i say💜 Sir im beyond Proud 💜
"I really love this, thank you. It's incredible !"
Power and ablation artistic drum performance is really great... 아주 좋아요....!!!!!!😁
Legend×Legend😭😭
Wow... I can almost hear black or white from Michael Jackson 👏👏👏👏👏 Respect!! 😎👊 💜💜💜💜💜
Master of master I can't imagine BTS with this gentleman salutes from Costa Rica Pura Vida 🇨🇷
Totally love it! Your play + the song... perfect.
""" I applied my moffetization"" = I made the time of this song better than the master."
Love you and BTS 💜

"Lloré, no me esperaba esto"
이건 진짜 MJ가 가지고 있던 비트이다. 정말 좋다.
What a collaboration🥰🙏💜 MJ  Mr. Sugarfoot Moffett  BTS  💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"Wow, love this so much!  What an absolute honor to have you cover this wonderful song!  BTS would be so thrilled!  Thank you Mr. Moffett!"
🤩😍🥰🥰😍🤩🤩😍🥰🥰🥰 🤩 😍😍😍😍 I miss MJ.
"No wonder you should play with BTS. I am glad you also liked my vlog #SugarfootforKPOP. This is a dream come true for me, seeing an MJ band member covering a K-pop song I look forward to seeing you or even MJ’s This Is It band playing with BTS or in KCON. Do visit South Korea and play for everyone. God bless Sugarfoot!  Let’s all trend #SUGARFOOTforKPOP so that more K-Pop Idols will notice him and make him guest with them!"
keep up the good work Jonathan moffett  and you are one of the greatest drummers of all time.
I'm glad you're still drumming to new music! It makes me happy to see someone who helped make some of the classic pop songs we know today come to life also support & have fun with recent hits. :D
I was so happy and touched that the great Michael Jackson drummer played dynamite. I still can't believe it. What an honor! I really want to see you perform on the same stage with Bts someday.

No se ve la letra
"Jin studied in Australia  Me : No wonder where he gets the ""hELLo iM JiN, iM wOrLd WiDe hANdsOmE"""
Jin: a singer who can act Mitchell: an actor who can sing
There is a good looking boy and his arm is around Jin's shoulder Ben: standing 5 feet apart Jin
"I know Jin is the most mysterious person in BTS, who knows how many nd what kind of surprising news we'll get about him in the future🙄"
"When she mentioned *""time travel""*  I was like: *""yeah damn he does that- thats why he never ages uwu""*"
Wow. This is so crazy. I had no idea they were friends.
Bruh is no one going to talk about the fact that Jin wanted to hide that he went to Australia but someone released them without his permission? That’s kinda sad :(
"If ppl didn’t know Jin studied in Australia, do u think they know Namjoon studied in New Zealand👀👀👀"
Marvel: We did the best crossovers Random Australian school: hold our vegemite
People: I ain't ever seen two pretty best friends.  Jin and Mitchell: Are we a  joke to you?
I didn't know that my disney crush Mitchell Hope and worldwide handsome Kim Seokjin are childhood friends... I was really shocked❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jin: *goes to australia* Also Jin: Now i've traveled WoRlD wIdE
When you find out the friend who was shy around you back in the day is out on international television topping charts and calling himself World Wide Handsome
Now Armies Who don't Even Know About Who is Mitchell Hope....  Army: Let's Follow Mitchell on Social Media 😂😂😂
"They were just classmates though, not exactly ""childhood friends"""
*It's amazing that both became* *successful people in their chosen* *fields.*
this whole comment section talking about how they didn’t know that they were friends *while I’m sitting laughing hysterically*
“To not get beaten up by people”!? Alright tell me who tf bullied our Jin!
"1:01 ""He is also loved in Korea *for his good looks* "" Yep.. Sounds like Korea They too obsessed with looks"
"Video: ""who is he? Lets find out today"" Thumbnail: ""spoiler alert"""
"I'm a fan Of Ben ""Descendants"" And Kim Seokjin ""BTS"""
"if small Jinnie was in my school, I wouldn’t have left single chance."
"Jin: I have no friends Me: Me too Jin, Me too 😭😭 Mitchell: Me and Jin are childhood friends! Me: Wh- ah screw y'all"
I can imagine how Jin friends will be like when they notice that jin is a member of BTS
"Of course two good looking  people would be friends with each other, the “I ain’t never seen two pretty best friends before” went out the door for this one"
i wonder how mitchell feels knowing he knew worldwide handsome when he was international shy guy 😭
"""I ain't never seen two pretty bestfriend before"" left the chat"
Mitchell: EYOO Friend l'm an actor in Disney Jin : YOO Bro I'm a woldwide singer in BTS
"“Perfect students with backpack and glasses”  So, im actually a perfect student after all"
Admit it or not  Jin is a frickin time traveler
"“Hello my Alien” “You and the cause of my euphoria” When I’m feeling “Blue and Grey” The “Winter Flower” that gave me “Wings” When I was longing for “Spring Day” I want to “Be” your “Shadow” I’ll “Run” to “Wherever you are” Cause when I’m with you I’m in “Paradise” So please don’t wander far. Anyways “Moving on” because of you I was able to find my “My Time” Look at my “Reflection” and smile I “Let go” of my “Persona” I had “On” for along while, So “Let me know” when you’re down, when you’re In a lot of pain I’ll tell you “The most Beautiful Moment in Life” Always come after “Rain” And if you ever feel “Lost” and can’t find “Home” “It’s No Big Deal” just remember  “You Never Walk Alone”                  I purple you 💜"
Jin : worldwide handsome Me : having a crush on him
So Jin Knew English!? OR DID MITCHELL HOPE know Korean!?😳
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT MITCHELL HOPE FROM DESCENDANTS IS ACTUALLY JIN'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND??
Jin: I have no friends.. Mitchell: Am i a joke to you? Edit: Why does this have so many likes!?😅😂
When she mentioned time travel....I started thinking of BTS's storylines in which jin was given the role of a time traveler
“i aint never seen two pretty best friends. 1 always ugly” 💀
Ok wait.....so yall tellin me Jin and Mitchell are friends?? Worldwide Handsome and a VERY handsome Actor?? ARe fRIeNds!? YO MITCHELL YOU BEST GO MEET YOUR CHILDHOOD BEST FRIEND AGAIN
it’s not really a fashion that’s their school uniform. Cause my friend goes to that school.
We should never loose contact with our friends ......jin has real friends ☺️☺️☺️
I know Jin from BTS (fan of BTS) I know Mitchell from Descendants (fan of disney) Lord this is such a dream come true
"""The boy next to him has a big smile on his face""  The two boys: Baby we're not even here, we're just hallucinations."
The fact that his last name is hope  lol.  And he is friends with seokjin-  You know....  Because J-HOPE.  Lol.
Mitchell: how do i reunite with jin? Lisa: CHILLIN LIKE A VILLAIN YEAH I RAH RAH EY
"As a big fan of Descendents and a fan of BTS, this makes me really really happy"
"I really can't believe it! Mitchell Hope, my disney crush, and Kim Seokjin, my worlwide handsome crush....... besties???? I'm SHOCKED, Really SHOCKED."
I can see Jin  making his acting debut in Hollywood...I'm putting this out to the world!! Please hear me...
I ain’t never seen two famous best friends-
"Imagine being the two other guys in the photo and thinking ""Man, where did I go wrong in my life that my classmates are world famous and I'm not?""."
THEY'RE CHILDHOOD FRIENDS??? OMG IM A HUGE FAN OF DESCENDANTS!
Holy shit u kidding right he is that descendants guy right omg he is Jin's friend dude not only Jin is handsome even his friends are wowow
Who wouldn't want to be friends with seokjin
I love how mitchell never told about it before like he could have easily gained fame by telling everyone i am jin's friend or i was his classmate or smth this shows how good of a person he is!
"SO HE KNEW ENGLISH THIS WHOLE TIME!? 😭😭 And I watched descendants all the time, and no one ever told me 😭 wtf  Edit: Why don't some of y'all understand. I know his English was ass, I'm saying it's the fact the he knew english even a little bit. His English could still be ass, but I'm saying that he knew it period. I know what I said, and y'all making it something different by telling a whole story about it. I know his story y'all 😐"
"""Jin English didn't improve""  Me:so how can he talk with his classmates teachers??"
ME who's a fan of Decendants:👁👄👁💜
When i first saw jin's childhood friend i thought he was chen🤣🤣
"Doesn't it look weird I mean Jin looks uncomfortable around them what if there opposite you know what if there not best friend ,what if he's getting bullied."
Wow I can’t believe that there were good old childhood friends I am speech less and soo shook😲😲😲🧐😧
"Jin's English is perfect.  Jin: No, his name is T. My name is J. Jin: Hello, how are you? I'm fine, thank you."
Me (who is an army and descendants fan): jumps high and clicks faster than before jk could say lets get it
Jin: I-I dont have friends Mitchell: am i a joke to you
I want Jin to be my friend too
As I thought Jin is a mystery With lots of secrets 🤧
MY TWO FAV CUTIES ARE ACTUALLY CHILDHOOD FRIENDS?!?!? MY LIFE IS COMPLETE
Jin: (seeing his childhood friend) Me: (not waning to see any of childhood friends)
Fun fact Jin doesn't like sharing that he went to Australia because he's embarrassed that he can't speak English 😭
You know how *HANDSOME* Jin was when he was younger and so *HANDSOME* right now too  Man he is so attractive
That's crazy and amazing. And the fact that they're both Kings 👑
The fact that they are both my crush👀
"Mitchell Hope and Jin are childhood friends? Seriously?😲,wow"
Never knew one of the characters I ship in Disney descendants with Mal is friends with worldwide handsome jin
"aaahhh imagine growing up and you and your bff become worldwide famous, im gonna cry just thinking abt thatt"
Thats extremely sweet 💜 And wow I am austrlian I didn't know his friend be Aussie and him study in Australia Whos an aussie ARMY here 👇
Damn my lowkey chuldhood and favourite artists-
Jin before: 🤓🧐🎒📚📏 Jin now: 😎😘👄🖤🎶 handsom  Me; 😥👄😍
Wait. Jin lived in Australia? Must have been super short. It would have been awesome to hear Jin speak English with an Australian accent.
Ben was a childhood friend of Jin and that makes me proud of these boys because they succeeded in their carrers.
Just another proof that Jin is from a very wealthy family.
Worldwide handsome jinnie have worldwide friends
Me knowing Mitchell and Jin didn’t meet 🙃 👌🏽
Im so shocked that Mitchell Hope and Seokjin know each other coz Descandants is my fav film and BTS is my fav band
OK done lie spit it out who laughed when they showed teenage jin 👁️👃👁️
I always wondered if Mitchell Hope likes BTS' songs because his performance in the descendants gives me a Jin vibe.
The guy that played Ben from Descendants is jins friend!?
"Me watching decendants and likes ""Ben"" And knows BTS that time and just knowing that they are friends: wtf ;-;"

"Haters☠︎︎: Jin Can't Even Speak English!!  Army♥︎: Dint you hear ""hELLo iAm Jin , iAm wOrld wiDe hAnDsOmE"" 😎"
"Two handsome bros, chilling in a hot tub~  Five feet apart cuz they're childhood friends ❤️"
Jin really loved that red hoodie 😂
You don’t understand how much of a shock this is-
It’s amazing how we heard of a celebrity and never knew one of your biases were friends with that celebrity.
i choked on my water when i saw the title edit: i-i......earth is indeed a small world
Filos already knows that Jin has celebrity childhood friend.

BTS changed their voices after years 😥 grew a lot
Hobi changed from sunshine to ahm real quick 😩😭
"Their changes are unbelievable. Each member has a brand new style, a new concept, they are now themselves and grew up so much."
Everybody is talking about taehyung.  But they miss jimis oneside undercut hair.  Andddd NAMJOON also looking damn handsome.
"While watching they perform their old song ""Boy in Love"", I feel like I'm a mother who is so proud of their sons' success. I'm so proud of being army for a long time."
"They aren't boy in luv anymore, they're MAN in luv damn bts's glow up is on another level"

V is so cool rm is so funny
"omg, who watch ENHYPEN fan meeting after here 👍"
the concept suits them more now but their voices don’t match 😭✋🏼 they’ve adjusted to a softer tone for their current music and can’t growl like they used to obviously to not damage their vocal chords. adorable.
Suga tongue technology thoooooo
I'm obsessed with the taehyung growling and everyone shoulder rolling part help me
i love jimin voice so much🥰
"Oh , my god so wonderful"
Tae swag style for the intro just-
Tae’s growl is killing me🥵🥵🥵
"Y el ""oppa"" de jungkookie?XD."
Jimin hairstyle reminds me of Jay's when doing I and incredible performance in I-land
our boys left us barely breathing with this one 🥵
"What the hell, Taehyung.  You making me feel some kinda way."
"The thing is they still managed the choreography!🕺💃 They r really hardworker! Im proud of u BTS! I LOVED IT!😘😌🤗 I LOVE THEM ALL!😘😌🤗 SARANGHAE❤, BORAHAE💜 BTS!❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜"
Bts is all I need in my life
"Kim Taehyung is a criminal and a killer...he stole my heart and killed me Plss call him out if he ever repeats ""I'm a good boy"" coz he definitely ain't one!!"
0:29 the way jk looks at tae
V's voice is very manly and they are so good

Jeon Jungkook is the cutest person in the world..
Jungkook come when jin was singing and jin scared hahahaah
"Thank you, for these compilation videos about JUNGKOOK, and your funny way of doing things. I had a lot of fun, he just isn't talented but has comedian skills.  Tae once referred to JK as his aspiring comedian. 🙋🤗😊🤩😍❤️💜"

Lost on the first clip and then didn't even bother to try for the rest of the vid lol
I’m at the point where I find anything BTS do is funny
Title : Try not to laugh Me : Came here to laugh 😂🤭💜.
"Fun fact: Every person, I repeat every person, even if he/she is not an army, loses this challenge badly...😂😂"
"Jin is a whole mood he said "" I read a whole page today what a productive day"" why is that me asf"
As a seokjinnn biased i can't stand there while he's laughing his horse laugh 👍😅🤣🤣🤣🤣💜💜
Comedians: just 7 guys in a house is not gonna be funny   BTS: you sure about that?
"Sometimes I can't believe these crackheads are the same ones who got nominated for Grammys. I love this fandom. Btw, can we just talk about Hobi's little ""I'm so scared"" at 9:08 ?"
9:50 why is tae hitting almost every note lollll
1:53 STOOOP HIS LAUGH IS CUTTTEEEEEEE
While Jin eating mangoes =Isn't it so classy Me = yes indeed *Jin Eats and chokes Me =oh boiiii
1:28 when your mom forces you to take a picture
How can legends be weird?🤔🤔 BTS are legends of Korea  They always make weird things but not embarrassed yet 🙂 They are being the themselves 😁 that's why we all all love them 😊💜
jin scolding jk for eating only the topping of pizza then proceed to eat the rest never is not funny :)))
"the video started immediately on jin's laugh, did you really expect anyone to get past that ?"
Off I jimin today............edit: after hearing Jins laugh for many years I obtained Jins laugh and now I sound like Jin when I laugh.......................👁👄👁😶😶😶😶
Please 🥺 RM got so happy when he found out they were making fried chicken 🍗 🥺💜
i love how they don’t  try but they’re still funny
Me: I am not going to laugh Also me: Starts laughing before the video even starts because I was just thinking about them.

I came here to be healed. 💜😍
"While the video continues, i try not to laugh what jin said 1:05      I CaN rElAtE-😭"
"Jin waking up J Hope and Jungkook very early in the morning. Why don't we see all the reactions from Namjoon, Taehyung and Yoongi? I wanted to see all the reactions Jin waking all the members up. I don't know what time it was early in the morning. I wouldn't like to wake up anyone that early in the morning with firecrackers. But I'll pounce on that sleeping person and wake them up like that. But not when there's not light in the sky and it's 5:00 in the morning. I love Jin's strange morning routines early in the morning In The Soop. He likes to hit the red punching bag every morning. It makes him feel better says Jin in one of the episodes from In The Soop. Hahaha I love Jin. I hope we'll meet someday."
Poor V ... 💜💕💕
"I almost lost when Jimin sneezed in the middle of his sentence but I managed to stay strong >:D You asked us to take it seriously & actually try, so I did~ I guess I can be your main boss with these challenges:DDD I like all the clips you collected, it really shows how real they are, that they doesn't just say ""they are just 7 guy from SK"" to look good in front of camera (I could bet that there are some ppl who thinks like this)"
I didn't laugh the all time but when jimin sneeze I laugh so hard for 15 min
"45th view, 63rd like, 17th commenter..🤠🥳💜💜💜"

"3:21 Same, Jin is my soulmate without being mates."
"*Jimin trips and falls down* Jimin - Why are you not picking me up😡? Jungkook - Because Jin bro told me not pick up useless things🥺. Jimin - I am not useless😤. *Jimin gets up and goes to jin* Jimin - Did you tell JK that I am useless👿? Jin - Well I said the truth🤭. Jimin - Shut up hyung😠. Jin - Give respect bruh🙌. Jimin - Rrrrap monsta🗣.  Rm - What😕? Jimin - Jin is scolding me😭. Rm - Don't scold babies bro👶. Jin - Okay😏. Jimin - Love you joon😊. Not there on the video ,I wrote, I know this not at all funny 💜."

2:39 so funny kookie pose 😂😂
ME knowing BTS just makes me want to learn Korean so bad but IDK where to start
watch the other dubs here - https://goo.gl/taKWqn
He is the only person who can ship the members without getting in trouble
"“Next Yoon-“ “Yeah I’d like to see you try” “Just kidding I wouldn’t kiss Yoongi” “Uh next J-hope” “Yeah I’d like to see you try” “ *Just kidding, wouldn’t kiss J-hope* “  The way I kept replaying this and couldn’t stop laughing 😂"
“Get jimin on the phone.” I’m wheezing
I can’t with the “JIMIN” 😭🤚
Jungkook:“Jin where’d  you even come from”  Jin:* windshield wiper laugh  *
Imagine Jungkook telling namjoon to watch this video💀💀💀💀💀
Jimin: Next Jhope Yoongi: DONT YOU EVEN TRY! Jin: YOU BETTER NOT PUT ME IN LAST!
I can't get over the fact how perfectly he does J-hope's voice😂
“thought this was a solo shoot why’s Hobi here” it’s night but that just made my day-
"It's not a BTS dubbed video if he doesn't yell ""Jimin"". I bet Cam's neighbors know his name"
I’m not even mad with how quickly I clicked this
"Jimin: next, Yoongi J-hope: *_I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY_* Jimin: i would not kiss Yoongi"
"""Ranking member of how kissable they are, first: MySelf"""
“Jimin! Where even are you-?” 💀
Nobody:  Sope: YeAH i'D liKE tO sEe yOU tRy      jimin: ᵒᵏ ʲᵘˢᵗ ᵏᶦᵈᵈᶦⁿᵍ
Seriously tho why did he choose to work out in LEATHER PANTS like-
The dislike is from Jin cause Jimin don't wanna kiss him
"""Yoongi"" Hobi: ""I'd like to see you try""   ""Hobi"" Yoongi: ""I'd like to see you try"""
Jungkook being sad that he thought jimin wasn’t his best friend and then Sope telling jimin that he can’t kiss  them is so funny  😂
"""I need someone to heat me up. stat""  ""I legally can't do that"" ....        ""Get Jimin on the phone"""
“Get jimin on the phone” 😂
Jimin: next yoongi-               Hobi: *yea id like you see you try-*
"Jungkook:""*sound of blow dryer*ugh*rolls eyes* this is not what I meant when I asked for a *LOW job"" 🏃‍♀️💨💨💨💨"
Was I the only one that thought namjoon running was attractive 🙋‍♀️
"Jungkook: that’s not what I meant when I asked for a blo— Me, already seeing where this is going: CAMMMMMMMM"
“I’m legally not allowed to do that” “Get Jimin on the phone” Cam I-
No one's gonna talk about how it fits so perfectly when Jimin said big tiddies.
BTS: Doing random stuff  Staff: GET THE CAMERA WE NEED TO FLIM THIS  Wow
"""Next, Yoong-"" ""Yeah I'd like to see you try"" ""Just kidding I wouldn't kiss Yoongi"" ""Uh Next, Jhope-"" ""Yeah I'd like to see you try"" ""jUsT KiDdInG WOuLDn'T kIsS JhOpE-""  IT'S 1 AM I'M TRYING NOT TO CACKLE 😭😭 The sope moments get me everytime😩"

I never get tired of jin's windshield laughter.
i was literally just thinking about you
This Namtiddies thing is never gonna sink and I'm here for it 😆
"1:39 "" Get Jimin on the phone."" ☠️☠️☠️☠️"
"He really said ""Get jimin on the phone"" 😂😂😂"
It's funny how jin isn't even on the screen but he's always there mocking them especially jungkook😂
“I thought this was a solo shoot where did hobi come from?”   My fav line!! 👌🏻👌🏻😂😂😂  Edit: at 1:27
“Get Jimin on the phone-“ I’m dead💀
"""get jimin on the phone"" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"No one:  Absolutely no one:  Jimin: ""next Namjoon - look at those lips"" My brain: ""Next Namjoon - look at those legs"""
tell me why it actually looked like jimin said 'TIDDIE'
"""Get Jimin on the phone"" I can't even-💀😂"
Jimin ranking the members’ kissability is exactly what I needed to see today. 😂 Thank you 🙏🏻
HA ’get jimin on the phone’ 💀💀
i came at the speed of slow wifi 🏃🏻‍♀️💨
"""Ranking member's on how kissable they are"" ""No.1 MYSELF"" - JIMIN (where's the lie tho)"
My puppy is sleeping on me and he woke up by the vibration of me literally dying bc of how funny this is 💀
I already love this and I haven’t even watched all of it yet.
The best thing is that the staff was probably actually thinking that when they took the megaphone away
“ oh god are they recording no ones supposed to know I’m this ripped” We already know how ripped you are Namjoon😎👏😎👏
Jimin with the megaphone is a mess - I -
Jimin: next yoongi  J-hope: yeah I’d like to see you try Jimin 😐 ok... then next uh j-hope Yoongi yEaH I’d LiKe To SeE yOu TrY We love the superior sope moments😳
"Sun : shines on kook Jungkook : I thought it will be a solo shoot, why is Hobi here?    Love it SKSKSKSJSJS"
I smiled the whole time watching this...just knowing JK probably will see this. The world needs BTS reaction videos to Cameron's bts dubb's 💜💜💜
I clicked faster then my grades drop
I was literally thinking of his dubbed series earlier
Get Jimin on the phone- I DIED🤣🤣🤣🤣
I HAVE RETURNED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE KPOP HOLE
I 100% agree.  Jimin does have the most kissable lips.!! 💋✨ uwu
"Joon's ""JIMIN"" gets me every time"
0:57  *jin in the back* Jin: “I KNOW U DIDNT JUST PUT ME LAST” Jimin:”yea because I wanna kiss something els-”😏 *Namjoon in the distance* J I M I N JDJCJSKCK PLZ IM DYING😭😭
namjoon running: 🏃‍♂️
JUNGKOOKS PEED HIMSELF AND IT WENT IN HIS SHOES *HYUCK HYUCK*
Please never stop making the dubs. I live off these.
nobody :       jungkook : ᵘᵍʰ ˡᵒᵒᵏ ˢᵒ ʷᵉᵗ ⁱⁿ ᵗʰᵉʳᵉ.
His deep ass voice for Namjoon though... I live for that
Clicked faster then namjoon could say jimin has no jams
Cameron's SOPE content is what I live for!!
These never get old 😂😂
PLEASE- This whole video has me running laps 🏃🏾‍♀️💨
"Dont mind me, I'm just having second hand embarressment feelings from imagining JK watching this video 🙈😂"
"This week, I’ve been suffering from a break up,ive cried 5 times, and when the times I wanna be happy, I watch ur streams,ur videos, you make me smile and make me feel better. Thank you cam for the hard work that you put into ur videos and ur ✨AMAZING✨ CONTENT. Ily cam🥺🤍"
The fact that I'm girl and namjoon's are bigger than mine 💀
Jin’s windshield laugh at the end tho
“get jimin on the phone” i CANT EVEN- 💀
Its 5 am and I'm watching this. What am I doing with my life 🗿
"Jimin: just kidding, I wouldn’t kiss jhope         Flashback when jimin stole jhope from yoongi"
I been needing another one 😭🤚
I SWEAR WHEN NAMJOON WAS RUNNING HIS SHADOW I-
I can never watch that video of namjoon without thinking about the picture of his shadow that looks like phineas from phineas and ferb 🤣
Literally your vidz be having me dead 😂💀😭
I WAS NOT READY FOR THIS NOTIF
off topic but who else just stays and vibes at the end with his song
"Namjoon: “4068, 406-“ Jimin: “9!” Namjoon: “Jimin!”                   Am dead with that 69-😭"
"""can someone please hold my hand"" ok🥺"
On a serious note does anyone else start dancing when the ending song comes on???
I’ve been waiting for this one TURN IT UP
Imagine walking around and seeing Jungkook getting out of a lake screaming “GODDAMN MY BALLS ARE FREAZING”
"""I can legally do that"" ""Get Jimin on the phone"""
"I just wanna appreciate how much effort Cam puts into making these dub videos, we love u Cam❤️"
Namjoon should be a Savage X Fenty icon as we speak.
Anytime you get a notification from Cameron Phillip you know yOuR’e In fOr A tReAt  -lots of love to the early peeps here
Jungkook and Jimin yelling the most bizarre things in *mortal Kombat style from the deep core of hell 💀*
"""get jimin on the phone"" jungkoookkkkkk💀💀💀💀😭"
"PLEASE NOT THE ""get jimin on the phone"" IM DEADDDD"
"The members saying ""jimin"" is getting more aggressive each video jejdkdd"
"I can't with Namjoon saying ""JIMIN""😭"
*D e a t h*           To anyone who threatens the Sope Ship 🛳 (Just a joke don’t be a Karen.)
"I always laugh when Namjoon goes ""JIMIN!"" everytime he makes a dirty joke or says something inappropriate. 😂😂😂💜💜💜"
"Logan: Pumpkin, get out of the phone scenes!  Pumpkin: I din’t have to!"
It’s funny how this is based of Adriana
We need SML Movie: Rosalina Vs Peach! Or just call it Mario's Ex-Girlfriend!
They need to bring back Kung Pow
Lance you better put on that “suck the chef” apron and teach Logan how to cook!
Lance I’m really surprised when you guys mentioned Peach  in the new SML Movie it’s been a long time and Peach is a really old character from way back.
Dear poobi   How do I deal with a girl
Question for Chris: How do you not impress a girl in 3rd grade?
"LANCE I LOVE YOU AND YOUR BTS SCENE VIDEOS SO MUCH, THEY ARE SO MUCH FUN TO WATCH. LOVE Y'ALL SO MUCH ❤🎆🎇🔥"
i have a situasion i ave to figure out wat i want to do in life  i havent even started 11th grade yet
When Mario asked to drop the charges mr Goodman should have said “Noooooooooooo”
Okay I can’t be the only one that saw the 8 PS5s behind the couch
Goodman is low key a good citizen “she needs to face the consequences of her actions”when he could literally buy a new car
The story is clearly about when Logan had Adrianna arrest for destruction of property and hitting him.
Sml idea: baKEN Junior and Joseph get sick of Cody thinking kens real and they throw him into the oven (I like the KEN videos)  please consider
BTS videos are so entertaining.
This is comedy gold
I love how Elaina is just chilling reading
"Sml Idea: Rosalina’s Improvement  Rosalina realizes that she’s been a bad wife since she came back after disappearing. So she decides to be better. She starts agreeing with Mario more, doing caring things, looking out for Jeffy while making sure he does the right thing, and not randomly accusing Mario of cheating. Shortly after becoming a better person, she decides to go back to Super D. Mario thinks she was just softening him up so he doesn’t get upset. But really, she does the bad stuff to Super D ‘till he breaks. Rosalina comes home, tells Mario the story, and permanently changes into this new character."
It’s been a whole minute and everyone already liked this video hats off to the SML crew
LANCE GANG
I like how pumpkin appears when rosalina was in jail
I love how loved records he does all the facial expressions he does while filming
"Rosalina should have a video where she realizes just how... well how do I put this, TERRIBLE she has been, so she decides to try and be a person, and now her character is permanently changed for the better, I mean I think people would really like that, and actually start to like her character"
My man brought Lovell just for one scene
i swear when i watch these and im high they are 15x funnier lmao
Man I love watching the BTS Videos they are entertaining to watch thank you for bringing some entertainment for a lot of people
I thought Elaina was going to lose her voice from all of that screaming she did!
The reason why Mario doesn't have his house payment because black Yoshi ask for money
"6:50 It's sad, I bet most of the kids watching this won't get that reference."
Amazing as always
Question for Pooby: How do you pick up chicks cause I really need one not for “reason” but for a supporting person that helps you?? Also for “reason”
Bro I just got the cough cough😭😭 it’s sooo weird not being able to taste or smell anything
You are the best!!💯✨
BANGER 🔥🔥👑
"I feel like this channel is better that able itself, not that that's a bad thing, I just love the crew behind the videos lmao!"
17:03 only og’s remember black yoshi and the birds
"Pooby question: how long did it take for you to master long scenes, or were you always just a god at them?"
I love these behind the scenes
"11:30 when Mr.Goodman turned around it was HILARIOUS! And also, who are the winners for the giveaway?"

Question for Pooby: What are the best ways to deal with stress and anxiety?
Lance lokey wanting to stab couch with sharpi lol
"Pooby, I sawed a boat in half and I used all my flext tape trying to fix it. I have no idea what to do now I could really use some advice.  Edit: flext isn't a typo i didn't know if I could say it because of copyright."
Question for Pooby: What do you think is the easiest way to make friends? I’m having a bit of trouble

Bro i forgot how good these were
(Make sure the poobstinator sees this) When I grow up I want to be a pooby when I grow up. Any advice?
Mr Goodman is his name And collecting house payments is his game!

Lance and Audrey I had such a bad day today. Thank you for helping me I love you guys so much 😭
I want advice on how to not complain about my arm?
How can I get my videos on the recommended page (I watched your videos when you first started and I saw every video)
Pobby question: how do I grow that beautiful hair
poobi    How do i get so serious like you? It looks like your either sad depressed or always mad
Question for pooby how did he reaction when Logan called him Palbo😂😂 when they meet
"I love your videos man, go Bucs"
What do you recommend for an HSPT?(Highschool Placement Test)
Question for pooby:  What advice would you give for someone who got really drunk and told thier crush they wanted to sleep with thier mother?
Wanna hear a fact? Yes. Ok Lance is the funniest best YouTuber ever.
Can we pleas get bloopers again 🥺😊😁
"I doubt this will happen but seems like just a fun/silly idea to just do because why not? I'd like to see a video that's pure without any planning whatsoever. Basically, a video that's purely improvised. It may or may not turn out well but perhaps worth a shot. Well, there probably should be a planned plot but at least everything else should be improvised (actions, lines, etc.)"
"Pooby, how do I get over my arm hurting? It always feels so week from when I jammed my pinky in the 3rd grade. As a survivor of a broken arm, how do you manage it to this day?"
it’s awesome you brought Goodman back. He is my favorite character.
Lance I've been a fan for 4 years and logan for 4 years and all of your content is so.. PEEPEE
20:40 y'all forgot 1 God that was Thor God of Thunder... also the  God's from Dragon Ball Z like Beerus and those guys
"15:07 Jinx😏😂, they owne both of them a soda"
Ask pooby- I am about to take drivers ed to get my permit. What advice to you have about that? I'm 16 btw
"Question for Pablo: when I was younger I fell off the monkey bars and broke elbow, my arm still hurts to this day. Any advice or suggestions to make the pain stop?"
"For Pooby what does it mean to be alone. Recently I feel alone but i have my family, I kind of feel like I am empty inside."
"Pooby, I have a rash on my butt and I can’t put the cream on by myself. What should I do?"
Hello I wonder how many people will ask about the giveaway winners this video even though they already said when they will be announced
"Ok so Dear Pooby, How do I come out of the closet to my family? How are you doing?"
LIVE OR REGULAR VIDEO OF THE GIVEAWAY?
Question for Pooby: What shampoo should I use
Oh you hit the car with a hammer let’s go inside 😂 I’m you big fan you always make me laugh

Wow you did such good work  also nice puppets!!
Question: I told a friend I had a girlfriend and I don't but I've used someone like specific and neither of them knows the truth. Should I keep the lie going or come clean?
Question for Chris: What would you do if a girl left you a read and delivered for a week?
I have some puppets and I want to know how to make the puppets seem more realistic with the movements of the puppet. This is the thing I asked from the advice from Pablo thing in the video.
i need a lot of advice ... pooby i know you got all of de ladies but how do i get out of a 4 year friend zone .... and how do i  start worshiping your arm?  :(
I think my pet fish is a vampire. For a while now it has been sleeping upside down. Any advice from pooby on how to wake it up and find out if it is a vampire?

"2:58  The mother Jin, who is in agony while giving birth to his child The helping doctor Tae, who tries his best to make the pregnant mother confident   The proud husband Namjoon, who cant wait any more to be a father  P.s. i am just joking guys. I am not being disrespectful to jin or anyone. Please stop fighting. Don't make ur selves idiots while fighting over a joke. Take joke as a joke."
"Jin: i. Am. A. Pig. Oink. RM: soo, we got a pig and six humans here. Armys: dies laughing😂😂😂"

"Jin : I’m a pig .. oink oink  Namjoon: so uhm, we got a pig and six humans here LMAO"
Jin: I'm pig oink oink  The whole group: 😑 Namjoon: yea we got one pig and 6 humans....
"If a person first watched BTS Run, bon voyage and in the soop without entirely knowing that they are the biggest band in history, they'll probably think that they're just young comedians in korea."

I feel bad for Hobi his heart got destroyed
"Attention Army, So our 8th anniversary goal here is to make 1B “No More Dream” l know it seems difficult but we have to do it, BTS always thought their debut wasn’t  good enough and didn’t want to look back on it. If we hit it on 1B, they will realise that they were kings before and now they are too. Let me step into first position now we can work together but we can share as much as you can on each platform and also in other languages so that we can work together on this.  Fighting 💜"
Fact:Even bts will also laugh and lose seeing this one oh my godd!!!!😂😂😂

"In my opinion, NAMJOON is the most improved member in this performance. Gosh, he looks so HOT!"
These 7 men are so handsome
Jungkookie kills it 🔥❤
Jimin in undercut is just fire.
Jungkook voice
"This song is still a banger here in 2021. And it sounds more and more polished every time I hear it. I'm so proud of them. And yes, Suga is back. Stay healthy guys and be safe. 💜💜💜💜."
RM : ARMY I CAN FELL U ME : YES ME TOO RM ME TOO RM : MAKE SOME NOICE...... ME : YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.......

JK voice OMG😱😱😱
jungkook is so hot
BTS King's of kpop  🧘‍♀️🔥.
Jungkookie ❤️❤️
Guys JK's voice back then when he was 18 was when he was still a teenager. REMEMBER??????? The changes in voice box and all... and now he is a grown up adult!!!! The difference in the voice!!!!!!! Damn!!!!! Save me 🥵🥵💜💜💜💜
"I’m leaving for the “army, make some noiiseeee” I love you for updating the concert! Thank you for the work!"
"Cameraman: *starts shooting, sees Kookie and Joonie* Camera: *Stays on Joonie and Kookie throughout the performance mostly*"

For all the (probably new)ARMYs worrying about Yoongi's shoulder : This performance is from their online MOTS:one concert held in October 2020 before his surgery.   He's still under recovery. Chill!
J-Hope will forever look ethereal with dark/black hair

Jin🦄💜 Worldwide Handsome ✨💥🤩😍
JIN JIMIN RM V JK SUGA J HOPE BTS LOVE YOU ARMY 😍😍
"Paparazzis should learn their limits. *Being a paparazzi doesn't mean, stalking an artists' life and invading their privacy is an excuse.*"
It's because they always find the members going on dates with each other or going to buy banana milk😂💜
The only person Taehyung would go on a date with is Yeongtan.. The only thing Jungkook would go out to get is Banana Milk.. The only place RM would go to is a shop where they sell glasses.. Suga wouldn’t go outside at all cause he’s probably working on songs or sleeping.. Jin would go out to either buy mirrors or order some food to film EatJin.. J-hope would go out to buy Sprite or just play and hang out in the Sun.. Jimin would be at the shops everyday looking and searching for his lost jams.. (This is why it’s useless to stalk our Kings!)
I remembered when dispatch followed jungkook only to found out he's out to buy banana milk on his SCOOTER 🙂🤣Poor Dispatch 😪
"Dispatch (Boss): Any news about BTS? Employ: Sir I'm leaving my job. Boss: What? W...why? Employ: I just meet Namjoon and he taught me how to love myself and live my own life. 2- Boss: Any progress? Employ: Yes sir, I'm currently with Taehyung and we are having sandwich on a beach. 3- Boss: Any news? Employ: (Anxious) Sir I'm observing Suga and he has not moved a inch from past 2hrs. Should I call an ambulance? 4- Boss: Any news? Employ: yes sir, after searching 6 convince store straight Jungkook has finally found banana milk in 7th store. 5- Boss: Any news? Employ: Sir I'm with Seokjin and he told the members that he is going on a date. Boss: (exited)Tell me quickly with whom? Employ: (nervous sweating)with a mirror sir. 6- Boss: Any progress? Employ: sir I'm with Jhope and I think I am in love with him. 7-  Boss: Any news? Employ: Sir he asked for my help and now together we are trying to find his lost jams."
Paparazzi: No news 😴⏳🔍😕 BTS: Get lost bc you won't find anything. We're just working hard for ARMY. 😷🙌🙆
They think BTS are going on a Date but Jungkook is going to the stores the buy Bannana Milk  (also this is heart breaking BTS are human to and need there privately too😡💔)
Paparazzis need to learn how to respect the private lives of celebrates.  Edit ; Typo - celebrities
"""BTS  problem is they have no problems"" lol so accurate words"
The fact that not a single person can get into BTS security/body guards- if ya did- 💀
*Can you imagine wasting your time stalking someone only to find out they’re buying banana milk and then riding on a scooter................*
paparazzi: *stalks Jungkook thinking he has a girlfriend* Jungkook: *goes to buy banana milk* 😂
Just because you think they’re dating someone doesn’t mean you can stalk them. You have no right to go into their personal life.
"y'all remember the time they stalked jungkook only to see him going to a convenience store and coming back out with banana milk while riding on a scooter 😂😂 edit: y'all keep asking where it is, just look it up on youtube or something"
i am laughing like a idiot here    the cartoons-🗿
Literally there is nothing bad you can every find of BTS they are such angels .
"""They have zero relationship rumors because they are WISE""  Not that they have never been in a relationship.  I hope every ARMY support them, when they are ready to tell people about their partner/lover. No matter who that person is. It may be an idol from other group (prolly not the group you stan), or within the group, or even a common citizen. We should respect their love, privacy and wish them luck for their future."
"Bts and army's are legends 🙌 , who else agrees?"
"""We can't go on any longer"" After stalking for about more than 7 yrs that's what u got😆I mean they are so natural they don't need lie in their life it's not included in their vocabulary 😌"
BTS is a good example of being a famous people but still have a humble heart and pursuing what armys happiness.. Thats why I really love them because of their authenticity and beautiful message that can help us to grow with confidence.
"I'm glad that they aren't being stalked, but those fans who say stuff like ""BTS is too busy to date"" are either knowingly making up excuses or are simply delusional. I mean, the members always seem to have time to meet up with their other celebrity friends amidst their busy schedules, so how can you logically claim they don't have time for a serious relationship, or even just casual sex? They're rich, very attractive young adults surrounded by rich, very attractive young adults. We don't even know everyone they're friends with, so they're obviously able to keep things hidden when they want to. Yoona for example; she and Tae had apparently been friends for years before we knew about it and they'd likely met up a lot in that time... they could easily manage the same with a partner, no?  While I can't deny being interested in their personal life, I can acknowledge that it's none of my business. This comment was solely in response to fans who make claims about BTS' life that make no sense. I'm not even saying they ARE dating; I'm just saying it's stupid to pretend they have no time to do so."
Paparazzi: let's spy on them!   BTS : Go eat out together

They stopped stalking because... Namjoonie: been collecting crabs when they follow him Hobi: practicing dance when they follow him Jimin: falling off a chair while laughing when they follow him Taetae: Enjoying the beach with Yeontan when they follow him Jin: looking at the mirror and winking when they follow him JK: bought banana milk on a scooter when they follow him Suga: hasn't move for 10 hours when they tried to follow him 😅
Paparazzi: Jungkook! Tell us where you are going this late at night. Are you dating someone? Jungkook: I'm going to buy banana milk....
"Imagine looking in the mirror and thinking ""wow I'm super talented, rich, famous and handsome. everybody loves me"" because bts can"
Do u guys remember Dispatch was following Jungkook around but he came out of the store buying banana milk and went off in a scooter.
"uk.....i secretly hope that they do have a dating life.... They are young and they should have their own private life. I hope they are not getting caged due to all their fans and papparazzi's. True..we all dream and wish to be that girl to marry one of them, but let's be realistic and not get delusional. I really do hope that they have a private life that we are not aware of and that no one finds it out unless they reveal it themselves. I wish they remain happy and enjoy their lives...they are still so young!"
"😂😂 the fact that he said "" BTS's problem is that they have no problems"". That really hits. I dunno why but that phrase is...😂😂"
Paparazzi : you will disappear from America  Yoongi : you will disappear from earth 🔥🔥🔥
They are just looking for something to write bad about BTS unfortunately the boys are clean
'BTS's problem is that they have no problems'  😂😂😂
this fandom gone crazy🌚
"I mean did you guys really think they were lying when they said ""were only 7"" and that ""there's always all 7 of us if not we get lonely"" they really are only 7 BTS X ARMY forever"
“ our boys are smart “    Best staff member Goes to this staff who said such an Wise/fact Word - 2021 ✨
Paparazzis and Journalists really do need to chill and give celebrities some privacy.
"1:51 The staff answered, "" Our boys are smart"" Look Our full family is proud of them 😏"
"BTS are also *HUMANS* they need their *PRIVACY* too  I mean, imagine they stalk you 24/7 without u even knowing and the next thing u know, the news talking about you buying banana milk"
"Paparazzi is the responsible when Princess Diana of England died in car accident many years ago they stalked whenever the Princess go,that's why BTS are very careful and ignored them💜💜💜"
"""there's always just thr 7 of them""   -dispatch"
Paparazzi: can't get into BTS life America: getting into the Capitol
BTS are very well protected. BigHit and the staff do everything to keep them safe and secure. And their privacy must be respected.
2:45 rice cake jimin just pop out of nowhere
Sasaengs and Paparazzi are no different They don't know what *PRIVACY* means
Claim your early  golden medal and trophy here **Hands to you :D**         🏅🏆
like the time dispatch went to spy on jungkook and all they got was him buying banana milk from the convenient store bcoz they ran out at home and another time when they thought they had finally caught something but it was just jungkook and jhope having a lunch in the middle of a dark field lol
Just remembered that time when dispatch followed Jungkook thinking he is going on a date or something. .but actually hE wAs gOiNg tO bUy bAnANA MiLk oN HiS ScOoTeR 🤦‍♀️
Paparazzi boss: any news? Paparazzi stalker: can I come back please they are playing with squirrel since an hour😭😭😭?
That moment that you really want to know everything about them. But you want them to be happy and safe so you don't want to know everything about them.
"""BTS's problem is that they have no problems"" Wow thats a nice line and thats the fact too."
Paparazzi:stalks J-Hope Jhope: seeing having lunch with pd nin😅
We still can't forget that when dispatch followed jungkook because they thought he was dating but he went to buy banana milk😂😂😂
"even if they had something in their private lives, it's private for a reason, people should respect that. All idols are human too, what if these paparazzi were constantly followed, I'm sure they wouldn't like it. I'm just glad that They are good at handling such situations and that they have good protection around them"
Bighit will sue them 👁️👄👁️
"""People forget what's special when they get too familiar."""
"Just remember these two words: Princess Diana. Thanks to paparazzi, she meant an untimely death. Thank goodness BTS has staff protecting them."
"Jin : I am going on a date  R: we are gonna get dirt on him Jin : *bringing a mirror put that in front of him*  wow my wwh face R: can I go home already....  Jk: *on the way for his banana milk*  V: *dating Tanni*  Jimin: *finding his long lost jam* (hope he will find soon)  Rm: *throwing away his phone and searching for it ever 5min* Reporters: *so done*  Hobi : going to buy his hamburger -*and sprite*  Suga: get up writing a song , going to sleep  *didn't even move for the next 9hrs* Reporters: *panicking*"
This is sad that they don't have privacy or secret fun especially in foreign countries because of paparazzi.
I still remember when dispatch was following jungkook and turns out that he went out to buy banana milk and they were restocking by going to the closest market and jk was riding a small motorcycle 😂😂🥺😂
"*""BTS problem is that they don't have any problem""*  Just these words are enough to describe our Kings ... 😶😶😶😶😶"
Boss :  today you will be focusing on suga. papparazi ; ok sir  few hours later~ Boss : any news? papparazi : sir...I have been sitting here for the past 10 hrs and suga didnt even move from his place..  lol
Paparazzi.  I feel like Paparazzi is jealous because Bts members literally Go on dates with each other or be with Bang PD in Public😂💜
Jungkook mind: imma buy some banana milk (hops on scooter)  Paparazzi: the target has moved lets go Jungkook: oki we here Paparazzi: okay i wasted my time on a guys going to get banana milk on a scooter
Do you remember when paparazzi thought jungkook is dating only to find him going to shop for buying banana milk..... Hehehe to all papparazis I know a secret about jungkook that he is dating banana milk...... You can guess the place where they go for date😂😂😂😂😂
"BTS had the best management team, they've realise and educated on how to behave in public how to handle public  BTS known for their hardwork and humble life"
“ our boys are smart ” yesss i love bighit staff
"3:53 ""Jimin and Jhope once tried to have some private time on their own""  Paparazzi : *WRITE THAT DOWN*"
"5:16 i feel bad.... the other members are kinda of lucky they didn't understand.. joon is like"" imma beat this b**ch up"""
RM looking for tips on how to become  a better leader Jin looking for more dad jokes to tell Army  Suga looking for Americano coffee  J-Hope looking for Sprite  Jimin looking for alcohol with RM so that he could laugh some time out I would of said V looking for coke but he said he stopped drink coke so he's looking for water to keep his mind out of coke cause that's something I would do  Jungkook is looking for banana milk and praying he doesn't find a microwave
video : the pictures of angry celerbeties is bad   me : pictrures of angry yoongi makeme happy cry
Their dating all armys and they know it 😂 What loyal babies 💜
can we just talk about the pictures that Dispatch took of BTS : jungkook going to buy banana milk on a thricycle  jimin going out of the building brushing his teeth and dancing and jhope having a meal with PDnim  those were legendary shots LMAAOOOOO
Namjoon's face legit said: This bish had the audacity (the moment where the actor hired said they were gonna disappear from America)
"Big hit staff is a mood ""our boys are smart"" definitely 🥴"
Our boys are very smart and the staff too. They will not be involved in such bad behavior cause they care about the team and themselves
"As an ARMY, I could care less if they wanna date as long as they do no harm to others. They're artists whose products are supposed to be the music they make, not themselves."
"Now I'm convinced Jungkook's cameraman works really  hard, that paparazzi gave up on following them😂😂"
The cover for this video is so damn CUTE
paparazzi: namjoon is dating someone  baby armies: NOOOO ;-;  Me and 99+ others: OMG YASSSS DKSJWJSJDJSJS
"Boss : any news ?? What are they doing ?? Dispatch : Boss I m on my way to beach with Namjoon . We are going to collect crabs . Sir , he is so humble . I m in love with him. 😂😂"
"If i get to know one of them are dating I would be very happy for them . Coz they're literally grown up man , they can date or marry anyone they want . Army's are here for their music not for their personal life .. IF YOU ARE UNHAPPY COZ THEY LOVE SOMEONE THAT'S SO DAMN LOW OF YOURSELF.."
There are numerous articles and people who got immense amount of love just because they said good things (not even cheesy) just good things about BTS. We ARMYs instantly fall for people who say even one word good about BTS. It's so easy. Yet people and company like dispatch always try to take wrong routes. It makes me laugh.
Paparazzi:stalks yoongi Also paparazzi :wut? Yoongi is keep sleeping for 12hours Oh no
"I-   After 5 years of knowing them, I wonder how they r Soo patient and nice to everyone. ;-;"
Early! Loved this!💜💜💜💜💜💜 OMG I'm 3rd BTS is amazing! They work so that they can make music for armys💜
"1:50 ""our boys..."" 🥺🥺🥺"
This is insane. These idols are ultimately humans. They need some space to breathe. They always remain busy in their tight schedule. Over and above these stalking leave them no time to relax. They are really living in a strange society.
"""KPPOPIES PROBLEM IS BTS DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS."" No wonder why they been barking in every platform to hate on them. lol"
do you remember the time when dispatch tried to follow jungkook and then found him going to the store to buy banana milk with a hoverboard scooter...?
ARMY!! lets protect our boys! they also need privacy! I seriously wish that papparzi's would stop! ARMY we need to do something! THEY NEED TO STOP!!
"Ofc paparazzi won’t ever find anything juicy or controversial... they’re calm , smart, and devoted to army,,, they know how to keep us proud of them 💜"
1:19  others :answering questions. meanwhile  jimin:busy flirting with the camera (lol)
"It's weird that dating is considered a problem and I feel bad that I'm ""proud"" BTS have never got caught in a dating scandal. It's not normal for that to be an issue. As much as I want to marry suga one day lmfao.. I wish they could just do what they want. Love is a part of life and they are denied it because of the scandals and hate they and their partners will get. Imagine the uproar if BTS started dating. I feel so bad and I wish it was normalized for idols to date in Korea. Slowly but surely I hope.. by the time they are ready after all this hard work."
Jungkook would definitely be on a date with his banana milk😂😂💜💜💜💜
the way k-media will blow anything negative about bts but ask them to take about bts' grammy nomination...its radio silence!!! if bts were from my country and they had gotten a grammy nomination...my country wouldn't shut up about it.
Gee I wonder why ohh... right the got more respect for KPOP  groups and other celebrities  now and Corona virus finally we don't have to worry about the paparazzi stalking Let's all celebrate🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
They are scared of Agust D spitting fire on their face😉😏😏😏😏😏
I remember that incident when they stalk & follow jungkook I never forget that moment they think JK going for Date but he's just  going to shop  to buy banana milk It's so funny 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 even dispatch r give up on them 😭😆😂😂
"When Bighit staff said ""Our boys are smart"" I could feel that family vibe. They are best company in my view"
Paparazzi are no different from stalkers the idols can’t leave them alone for a second

Me trying to guessing the member's voice instead of the song😂😂
I am an international ARMY. So I know all the songs but I don't know the name.🤣😂
jk: I know movie but i dont know movie nameMe for half the songs: I know song but i don't know song name😂
Noone: Me: *pauses to sing the whole song til the chorus*
"If you've never heard Sea, please listen, it's a masterpiece"
"Easy: Passed Medium: Passed Hard: I got 4 wrong Suga - never mind BTS - purpose BTS PALDONGSANVUF ""something like that"" BTS - Look here  And I am army since 2015"
My stupid ass didn't get magic shop... My god I'm disappointed in myself.  Also didn't get Good Day but that is understandable... But other than that it wasn't even that hard 😁
26/30 🔥👄🔥 I've been an army for almost 4 years now and the fact that I know the lyrics in the hard part but not the title is making me go 🤡👄🤡
"I'm a bit disappointed in myself.

Can anyone tell me teacher to put this in my test paper .😂😂 💜💜
I didn't get I need u😖😟 I m disappointed😔 But its OK for me because I m new ARMY I became ARMY after dynamite 😔😊🤗
"99% of army fails and just vibin' with the song and forgot about the challenge, lol."
"i am a new army. I became an army a few months before the BE album came out. I got some of them right, i still need to listen to the older, older songs. :)"
THE FACT THAT I GOT ALL OF THEM RIGHT BUT I CAN'T DO THIS WELL IN SCHOOL BYE
I am just a A. R. M. Y. since 5 months but they are the best in the world and I feel like  I am a part of there live and they know mw as a A. R. M. Y. make me feel good 💜 they are the best thing in the 🌌 universe. The songs are just a never forgotten history of all time not they Songs they and there Songs. Later we will die but we can be happy to die as an A. R. M. Y. which loved the best people in the universe and support them. Maybe I can never see them live on a conzert but I know that they give the best for us A. R. M. Y. S. and that is why we should give our best to let them know that we learn from them and love ourselves. I do not love myself but I know that I love them. Yes there will come a day with the last song and last concert last run bts... but it is NOT TODAY.Bevore this day arrive we done our best decision of our life to love them and be an A.R.M.Y.. This day will be one of the baddest one in our life but the LIFE  GOES ON and they done they best to make us happy. They make me happy every time when they smile and be happy. If they are happy I am happy  and if they are sad I am sad and cry with them. They glow up like Dynamite Avery single day in the year for ever.
"My dumb, forgetful ass didn't get Not Today or No More Dream.. I literally said out loud 'I know song but Idk song name' 😂"
"My friend: Did you found all the songs?   Me: Yes, all the easy round. 😂😂"
"is it weird that ill know the words for the songs, run through it till i hit the chorus then finally realize the song. BTS lyrics are so engraved into my end, i have to at least run through the melody before i get it half the time."
"oh no 3 wrong  ""I know the song but I don't know its name"""
"i got all of them righttt yee ugh i remember when i was a new army back in 2017 and i was so overwhelmed with learning the members and all the songs, but look at me now :)"
90% armies came here to listen all BTS songs for free 15 mins 25 seconds 😂😂😂
Easy peassyyy lemonnn squeeezzyy~~~~
"It was a bit hard, i think😂 Anyway tnks for this, i got many recommendations by you💜"
I joined in army / liked them since 3 months ... I'm a bit Disappointed in myself cause i was able to guess the songs from the easy section ..... and this made me realize that I need to know more about them . i got all the songs correct in easy and I was unable to guess any song from medium and hard .....
Ok the hard edition was really hard ...cz most of the songs I haven't heard yet...but I know most of them
I got so excited every time i got one right lol i didnt do all that well but it was super fun to try
I know the song but i don't know the song name 😂😂
The fact that i know bts songs more than my exams matter😑😅
"It's disappointing that I don't know some songs,but it's been only 6 months since I became an army"
"I’ve been with the boys for almost 6 years and I must admit that I did struggle a bit during the hard level haha. If you would’ve chosen the hook or chorus for some of the songs, I definitely would’ve gotten more than Sea, Paldogangson, Look here, and Good day. As for the other levels, I did know all of the songs! And lastly, thank you so much for creating such a wonderful challenge 💜."
me: hears the song has to think and presses pause. my brain: continues to sing the song until I come to a part I can identify. please don't ask how that's working I don't know myself that's just how my brain works
Me: i think myself i am not one of the army because how can i know the song name. I don't watch bts earlier because i am blink at that time and i started to watch at 2020 of November or December. Armies: i think they know from start not like me
"I'mma add all the songs I've never heard to my playlist. As I said, I'm kind of new and I dunno all the songs"
them: guess the songs me: knows the song but doesnt guess it but sings instead
"No one, literally no one Me:pausing, singing the song until chorus to guess the title"
Is there is anyone who knows the song's lyrics but don't know the song name?🙋‍♀️
2:23 No one: Me: wow hobi you look so innocent in the background but.. those lyrics thou- 👁👄👁
"I’ve been an army for like 3 weeks, so it was very hard, i only got 4 of them right🥺 can i be forgiven?"
Most of the time i was like:- I know the song but i don't know the song name
me : i'm not that obsessed with them  also me : gets every single song right  *plays pied piper
"Me who guess only 1 song in medium. LOL  edit: when i finished this video, keep asking myself am I an ARMY? : p"
When you know the lyrics but the title isn't!?🥴 And when you know title but the lyrics isn't!?😭🤣🤣
I proved myself to be a premature baby army..I stopped half way through haha I’m taking notes now..I joined army at Christmas
Im the one doing  *hears the part* *Continues the Lyrics* Then i know
Omg I had almost forgotten all their old songs Jungkook was soooooooo cute lol
"Nailed it! Thanks for putting this together, it actually did get tricky towards the end, which is what we want."
Now I'm feeling embarrassed to say that I am an army...😭
Here is new army I became army before 2days of BTS comeback 'BE'  And for me loving BTS is best
Me knows every song but not song name     I know song but not song name -my version of jk’s “I know movie not movie name”
I was in the same situation like kookie.. I know the song but don't know the song name (ಠ_ಠ)
Nice video😊💜 Thank you for this challenge!💖
I didn't get a single song right except that beautiful from the hard section
The first thing I do is dance to that part but can’t remember what is the title and need to pause and sing till chorus I’m proud of myself for getting it right at the bonus part
"Me, who hasn't been apart of the fandom since they performed @ the AMAs: 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡"
1:00 = idol 1:24= not today 1:50= no more dreams 2:16= blood sweat and tears 2:44= boy with love 3:07=danger 3:36= I need you 3:59= fake love 4:31= on 5:02= dope 5:25= dimple 5:56= ma city 6:21= iam fine 6:51= ddange 7:17= lights 7:43= converse high 8:13= intro:boy meets evil 8:42= magic shop 9:11= cypher 4 9:34 = trivia love 10:05= born sing 10:37= sea 11:03 = wishing on a star 11:28 = outro:propose 11:57 = path 12:26= beautiful 12:53 = paldogangoson 13:20 = look here 13:51 = intro; never mind 14:20 =  good day Bonus round ( 15:04 ) We are bulletproof pt.1  Imagine getting pinned
Tbh I forgot it was a challenge half way through and was just vibing 🕺🏼💃
Wah I was satisfied with The Intro ATEEZ HALA HALA my favs My kings
me: who watches bts more than 7 hours a day and have been an army about 2 months and doesn't get any of the hard level ( I'm disappointed) also me: I guess I should watch bts instead of sleeping to know them more
When your favorite comes up: HAH— I CAN GUESS THIS EVEN IF ITS 0.1 SECONDS PLAYING—
Idk to be happy or not...  I just got easy ones all correct and as the medium and hard contained the song which I didn't knew... Thanks to this video I found some songs of bts 💜
Omg...I don’t know any of the hard songs...I just knew the names but haven’t listen them...how can I say that I am an army for 3 yrs😭
"Every song that comes on, i sing all of the lyrics to it, cause i know it 😭 but i can never figure out the title"
you don’t know how many times i had to replay the 3 seconds of converse high to get that right🧍🏽‍♀️
"Honestly, I CAN'T STOP STARING AT YOUR THUMBNAIL!!! Yoongi is bias-wrecking me again.🥺💜"
Me: I know the song but not the song name (ㄒoㄒ)
"07:40 I remember suga said ""he hate converse high cause it's hard to remove it from you"" HAHAHA"
I want to say I know all songs and their name and Also the everyone's voice I think I am real army😂💜💜💜💜
Im not even doing the challenge im just adding songs to my playlist😂💜
It's actually been 2 months since I became an ARMY so I guess 13/30 isn't that bad? ¡ᴗ¡ also I could've done better I definitely know more than 13 songs-
the fact i been an army since 2017 and forgot 7 😭 and i knew sum of the songs just didn’t remember the names
when you know the song but forgot the tittle that's really me hahaha im so bad at memories :(((
I am new ARMY .. and I admit that I didn't got all right..  But I am glad that I found more songs .. 😂💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I knew these songs but forgot their title. Am off to study more👋
Is it odd that I guessed all the songs listed as hard and they are actually my fav😶
"I'm so sad because of the song I forgot the title of their debut song 'no more dream """
Song plays.... Vibes with the song forgetting that I have to guess the title 😂
"Anneyong ARMYs!! I am new and I became an ARMY in the mid of Dec before my add maths exam 😂 I was looking for a stress relieve thing and BTS popped up and my first ever MV was FIRE. I liked it so much that I had my hand free in during language's exam and I muted the call and I was watching..... BULTAURONE.... FIREEE 🔥 Anyway borahae ARMYs, jincha!! Saranghae ARMY ibnida and GAMSAMNIDA for your SARANG💜💜💜 I am still waiting for my first comeback tho and my first vlive and first live performance and all the cool stuff and guys PRAY that BTS wins their first ever GRAMMY since it would bring a smile on our ANPANMANS' faces and what's better for us, I'll be like floating on the sky that day it would be like I am on the mountain, I'm on they bay😂 it would be like I topped in CIAEs Add math paper in the whole world, JINCHA!! Guys ARMY aka us are a family and SARANGHAE ARMY ibnida 💜💜💜"
I wish this is in our module and on exam too...i think many army's will perfect this test and became top 1
"all these songs are on my phone, but in the tricky part I still couldn't guess most:')"
After one month can someone comment on this so I can come back and retake the test. 😭💔
"gogo? love maze? don't leave me? home? jump? attack on bangtan? war of hormone? for you? make it right? best of me? dna? dionysus? anpanman? so far away? young forever? butterfly? heartbeat? pied piper? 2! 3! tomorrow? let go? paradise? love myself? black swan? life goes on? fire? mic drop? run? save me? spring day? boy in luv? n.o? just one day? perfect men? baepsae? 21st ceuntry girls? so what? dream glow? the truth untold? house of cards? spine breaker? dynamite? stay gold? UGH? jamais vu?  Good video, but some iconic bts song don't was in."
"I got them all, but if they'd played a diff part of beautiful I don't think I'd have gotten it, bse I legit only know that shesus line😭😂"
I just sat here vibing because I forgot the titles of most of them but knew the lyrics 😂😂😂😂
I've only been an army for a few weeks but im still disappointed in my score. I know song but I don't know song name :')
"Basta, ho confuso i Need u con fake love, mi sento uno schifo.. :'‹"
The fact I know every song name 😩
I'm a new army and I've been listening to their whole discography for only 3 months so I only got Easy 10/10 Med 9/10  Hard 3/10  hehe
Well thanks for making me knows a song of bts that i never heard before 😆😄💜
No one: Literally no one:  Me: I know the song but i dunno the song name ಥ‿ಥ
Know all the songs but confused coz i know too much🤔😔🙃👊
Ik all the songs and their names  Wow I didnt know it until I found out. I'm speechless.
I had problems with medium and hard but bonus round i won xD! I really like we are bulletproof pt. 1 the most jin's rap 😁😂
"Ive only been an army for a year and a month, I knew all of the songs but still had a hard time remembering a lot of the titles for the songs in the hard round. I am disappointed in myself 😭"
Swear I could NEVER in my ENTIRE life not realise it's nevermind and sea.
Every one talking about hard ones while I am literally stuck in medium. I am army since December 2020 only. So don't take me wrong senior army's😊
"give me rock star jimin NOW! also the best parts in my opinion are the prechoruses and the bridge (2:02), but let me know what you think! <3 also the ‘filter’ acapella i use isn’t the cleanest so i’m sorry you can hear some of the residual guitar noises in the background :("
"Love how the build up from 2:18 didn’t explode on the climax and instead was a fade out. It was an amazing twist, totally loved the mash up"
Cry baby coz it’s Park Jimin singing
"THIS IS SO AMAZING OMG I love bts and the neighbourhood, you did such a good job with this I love your mash-ups !!"
"for the 3  people who disliked this masterpiece , I hope your pillow is hot on both sides 😩"
The neighborhood and Bts always sound so great together and you do such a good job mashing them up together!!
me vibing to this while wondering why BigHit  didnt hire you as their producer
"BEAUTIFUL, ROCK STAR JIMIN AGENDA"
"thank you for making mashups of bts x the Neighborhood, they are my favorites ;-; 💕"
ouuuu I rlly like this one! could you maybe do a Spine Breaker (BTS) X Chronosaurus (Stray Kids) mashup at some point?? I’ve been thinking about it constantly😂
"bts & the neighbourhood, you rly know how to break a girl’s heart seokjinnie 😩😩"
This is such a vibe driving at night with this playing
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I swear your mashups never disappoint 💜
it’s my favorite the neighborhood song with one my favorite jimin songs. ah it’s just chefs kiss
"if i don't get a full depressed makeover into a dark, deep soul filtered person before going back to school while this is playing, then i don't want it."
literally perfect. the talent is impeccable
Omg I need this on SoundCloud RIGHT NOW🤩💕✨
Me reads cry baby  Also me crying right now :>
I definitely need more rock star Jimin in my life! Amazing mashup :D
uM HOLD UP NOT THIS BEING A WHOLE BOP
This has got to be one of my favorite bts mashups I've heard omg
*I want a mashup but I'm shy...*
WITH THE AMOUNT OF BTS X THE NEIGHBOURHOOD MASHUPS YOU'VE MANAGED TO MAKE INTO A MASTERPIECE IMAGINE IF THEY COLLAB LIKE THINGS ABOUT TO GET REAL CRAZY HERE
I already know it's going to be a masterpiece ❤️
Jimin is that kind of man whom you want as husband but can’t have. And this goes with everyone. It doesn’t matter if you’re man or woman.  And I love to pain myself with this reality 👁  👄  👁                                                                          💧         💧
"This sounds so good, you're insanely talented"
bts x nbhd mashups make me feel some type of way the good kind ofc
This song is my Cry Baby Filter
Ooh It might be nice if you did everytime that beat drop with no more dream. I've been seeing it all over Instagram ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
this mashup lives in my mind rent free
✨ m a s t e r p i e c e ✨
"THIS IS SO FUCKING AMAZING! AHHHHH this is so good, i probably never clicked so fast on something"
This is so amazing Jimin's voice kinda faster than the instrument but overall so good make the entire vibe change in a good way
Fueling my soul with all these bts x neighbourhood bops
THIS IS SO FUCKING GOOD I LOVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD  AS A MEXICAN I CAN REALLY SWEAR YOU ARE SO FAMOUS IN THE WHOLE WORLD
Mi mamá me dió la vida pero estos mashups las ganas de vivirla
Anything The Neighbourhood and BTS just hits. Literally my two favorite bands and they just hit different together. The vibe is immaculate. <3
Now I'm obsessed with this masterpiece.
Didn’t think I could fall in love with a mashup this fast 😍

Namjoon: “My child mastered Hangeul at the age of 4.” Armys: let’s act surprised
"Dear parents, just because your Child is smiling at their phone dosen't mean they have boyfriend or Girlfriend, they are just looking at BTS"
He looks amazing on every pair
RM: *choosing glasses to wear* Me: *waiting for him to break one*
Kim Namjoon doesn’t need glasses. Glasses need Kim Namjoon.
Popular opinion: Everyone agrees that Kim Namjoon is best leader in the world
"For any ARMYs who didn't get the joke, Joon was being sarcastic when he said, ""My child mastered Hangeul at the age of 4"". He was mocking obnoxious parents who love to brag about every single thing their child does. The glasses he picked made him look like a dad, so he did his best ""dad"" imitation. He's not literally saying that he has a kid himself.   Hope this helps. 💜"
"No ONE: IQ 148 KIM NAMJOON: ""I shouldn't look too smart"""
"Dear RM,    Who on earth told you to be too handsome"
For all the armys being confused with the child part he was imitating parents who brag about their kids (Don’t attack me I wish he had kids of his own too :)
Joonie: “I look smart”  ARMYs: you are smart.  edit: wtf THE LIKES!!!!!✊😭
RM IS THE WORLD'S MOST HANDSOME GUY NO ONE CAN'T CHANGE MY MIND
namjoon: my child mastered hangeul at the age of 4  armys: a children uhm? i already knew thanks
Popular opinion: NAMJOON IS HANDSOME.
Se dan cuenta que Namjoon le queda todo  Ese hombre es perfecto con cualquier cosa que se ponga  Es un amor!!!!!!!
namjoon: my child mastered hangeul at the age of 4  armys: *acts surprised*
"""I shouldn't look too smart"" LOOK AS SMART AS YOU WANT TO KING"
Namjoom: mi hijo conquistó hangeul a los 4 años   ARMY: verga que dijiste
"rm doesn't want to look 'too smart' maybe he should try harder-- cuz he looks classy in anything he wears, damn 😭🤚"
**Flashbacks to Namjoon breaking his new glasses he didn't even wear in AHL**
"If I was the stylist, I would've picked all the glasses as the best"
One if the most precious humans in the world
He is more handsome when he wears glasses 🤟😍😘💞. forever RM 💜😎
Kim namjoon Kim seokjin Min yoongi Jung hoseok park jimin Kim taehyung jeon jungkook BTS i love you ❤️😍❤️😍
No one: Literally no one: I want be the stylist who is with BTS
"""My child mastered hangeul at the age of 4"" Me: I'm not even surprised"
"En todos se ve hermoso, pero no pude evitar escuchar que Jk estaba cantando Jamais Vu <3"
RM : choosing glass  Fake channels : RM choosing glass for date 😣
For me rm will be so hot in all those glasses cuz how hot he is then with does glasses he will be more hot ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Cuando ví la caja de lentes dije ""salaverga es un chingo"" y cuando se probó los primeros solo pensé ""esos si son lentes limpios, no como los míos ;-;'"
"Joonie: ""I look smart"".  ARMYs: you are always smart"
"Not to be mean but its a false translation guys! What he meant was ""i studied hangul at the age of 4"" 💜💜"
Osea que ya tienes bendiciones namjoon... De todas formas ya lo sabía
Namjoon : I look smart  Me : u have a 148 IQ mister... Of course ur smart
RM: * Is just choosing what glasses to wear * 3.3M people: *INTERESTING*
No one:  Rm: My child mastered Hangeul at the age of 4
"RM you are the most innocent person I saw for ever after my father , you are the most strongest member in BTS , you are the  person who brought  7 members as a family , you are the person who raise them up in all their difficulties, you are the person who solves the fights between members and United them . Though you are not a father , you are the one who took care of your members as a father . We love you so much . That everyone hopes a person like you in thei life's . You are so cute . All the things you wear , dress , buy is matching for you because your heart is so pure and beautiful ."
I would've failed to choose if he were consulting from me coz he literally looks dope in everything
díganme q no soy la única q enserio c enamoro q su bias ;-;
Nam: my son dominated the world when he was only 4 years old.    L-ARMY: which son Namjoon? ... WHICH SON KIM NAMJOON? !!  NAMJOON EXPLAIN YOURSELF IN THIS MOMENT>: |
Namjoonie: I shouldn't look too smart.  We Armys : But he's already too smart😂😂😂
He didn’t break it... he’s grown so much<3
No lies but Namjoon looks smart when he wear glasses🤓🤓🤓
Si namjoon dice que está casado y con hijos nos sorprendemos Va!
Joon: My child mastered Hangul at the age of 4~  Me: he is just exposing himself at this point
HOW MANY INTERNATIONAL ARMY’S FANS are here??    👇👇💜💜
"Namjoon se ve tan hermoso con gafas, aunque también sin ellas es todo un bombón"
Namjoon trying to choose which glasses will he wear Me: My glasses are breaked ! My parents: No more glasses If u understand u r very clever ;)
Ok Ok mds o namjoon que me matar ne mds que perfeito lindo maravilhoso líder da minha vida💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"RM is the very first person I have ever seen who can rock glasses so hard. He is super handsome and hot on his own. But with (any of those) glasses, he is out of this world."
RM: Trying to choose the glasses  ARMYs: *Trying to understand why he is so atractive and cute at the same time*
"millions of people, including myself: DID SOMEONE SAY NAMJOON WEARING GLASSES? also, Sir you have an IQ of 148, you are the leader of BTS, OF COURSE YOU'RE SMART"
"Namjoon tiene una cajita donde guarda exclusivamente lentes,me siento bien pobre jaja"
*Army pls vote bts on sma voting app now!! (10 votes a day for each category) focus on 'main' category first then 'Kwave' category then 'legend' category then other category!* ‼
I got jealous when the girl call namjoon smart  (ಥ_ಥ) o_o”
"The glasses don’t make him look pretty, he makes the glasses look pretty."
AU AU AU  Cadelinha pelo RM   little dog by Namjoon
Ok! Who’s bias here is RM? I’d like to know!
How he tried 4-6 glasses but looked different and epic in all of them
In the second one he looks like Harry Potter. Love u RM.... Love you BTS..... ARMYYY♡♡♡
Namjoonie oppa should first check if he can actually wear it and not break it.
His visuals and aura are actually stunning
"If you ask me who is the most beautiful, beautiful and best leader in the world, the name of Kim Namjoon will undoubtedly shine in my mind."
CON CUALQUIER COSA PUESTA NAMJOONIE SE VE PRECIOSO ALTAS GANAS ME DA DE TRABAJAR N EL STAFF :))))))))))))))))))))))))
"RM is not trying to be handsome, but handsome is trying to be RM"
No c por que lloro viendo a RM probándose lentes 🥺🥲 es bellisimo
He was looking like a sexy and smart professor 🔥😍.... Love you bts 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Namjoon+Anything= True beauty
"Namjoon, te prometo q ya me voy a poner hacer mi tarea 😭😭✋"
True fact : Everyone agrees Kim Namjoon is the best president in the world
Somebody tell him he has an IQ of 148 and he is smart💜💜💜
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 Rm: my child mastered hanguel at the age of 4 Army:😮 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"Haha, Namjoon is very gracious, I hope to be at your side"
Aí meu Deus o Namjoon é muito lindo 💜🇧🇷
He looks like a president and that’s only facts
Is no one gonna talk about how he straight up said “my child master hanguel at the age of 4”? Are we even surprised at this point he definitely has a family.
"Still can't get over with that""My child mastered hangeul at the age of five""🤦🏼‍♀️"
"I love you, BTS with two options."
RM define la palabra PERFECCIÓN ❤️
“my child mastered hangul at the age of 4”  we know it’s not just an empty words dhdhdhdhd spill the tea joonie  y’all don’t take this seriously hdhshs i know he’s talking about himself
"You guys better remember to be surprised when Namjoon reveals his wife and 3 kids, understood?  *okay.*"
"КИМ НАМДЖУН, БЫТЬ ТАКИМ КРЫШЕСНОСНЫМ ПРОСТО ПРОТИВОЗАКОННО!!!! За что ты нам такой неземной свалился....🥺💔💔💔"
namjoon: my child mastered hangeul at the age of 4  me at 4 years old: *watching spongebob in my pj’s while eating cereal on the couch*
No one literally no one        ME crushing on Namjoon.
True fact: Everyone agrees that Kim Namjoon is the best leader in the world.
Namjoon é mt lindo vei pqp😭❤
For everyone telling RM has a kid: He loves to be a dad someday so can't he keep dreaming and waiting for a day like that? Even though I who is just 14 years keep wanting to have a kid cause it's so adorable to have a family. No problem married or not anyone can talk about his or hers future babies.
i want this namjoon to be my English teacher............
1:13 these glasses are really nice
Namjoon:Choosing glasses carefully  1.3M people: InTeReStEd
"Namjoon, bebu, luces magnífico con cualquiera de esos anteojos uwu."
HES SO HANDSOMEE STAWWPHHH
Hold up WHO MASTERED HANGEUL AT THE AGE OF 4
Namjoon you are beatiful with or without glasses💜
It's not like that he looks attractive just by choosing glasses; it's just that he looks HELLA attractive just by choosing glasses. Only facts here.
RM looks perfect with each of those glasses. I can't even believe it.
*0:16  RM:  Во.. Вот это*
kim NAMJOON :MY CHILD MASTERED HANGEUL AT THE AGO OF 4 ME:I'm glad to hear that. I wish to see namjoon's children and all the members wish them happiness as an army. 😭❤️❤️
RM 😊💜
Joon: “I shouldn’t look too smart”   Me: Someone remind this man he has an IQ of 148
Hope you guys enjoy my piano version of this song too. Hugs!! From an ARMY to ARMYs
Jin is finally getting the attention and lines he deserves
Man Taehyung and Jin’s vocals were amazing 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💜
"Jin high notes,  Jimin Rap  Jungkooks Improvisation V- baritone voice"
Why is no one talking about Tae's and Jin's wonderful vocals LIKE DAMN 😳💜✨  (They all have unique and beautiful voices💜💕)
Jin is consistent as always with the high notes... borahae.

Minha favorita deles! estava curioso para ver a performance ao vivo 💜
I really like Jin and tae's vocals
"Omg Jin's high note I' am dead bye,Jimin i love you so much"
they should give more lines to jin bro he's so stable
jin is so stable live. every year and comeback he continues to improve and never slips. at this point it's just insane that bighit isn't giving him more songs.. not saying he should have the most in every song but why can't it be most balanced instead of 2 members always getting half of the song... it just doesn't make any sense. we want more jin
Jin and Tae angel voice

So I guess travelling for me is doing my modules with these uplifting songs.
The thumbnail is perfect too its soo aesthetic 💕
this playlist in magic 💜
"Traveling? Nah...Doing my homework atm, while listening to these songs <^*^>"
"This playlist is for travel but, I just woke up from a dream where there is a lot of zombie and my 5 years old sister is being attacked but luckily I saved before getting a bite. And then I took my sister and my other two brothers, I was really scared and I cried a lot. I woke up and searched up a playlist in my saved up playlist I saw this and I was so happy because this saved me up and I also get to know I will still get to play with them. Thank you!"

私はパンスト被った君たちも好きなんよ！！
ユンギちんのやる気スイッチを入れる方法 ・ラップさせる ・ホビを側に置く ・バスケットボールを与える ・ストッキング←NEW!
おそらくスタッフがイッテQと同じ
被せられた後恥ずかしそうにしてたのに急に吹っ切れた様にキレキレで踊りだすのしんどいww
爺ちゃん必死なの可愛すぎた笑笑
0:56     1:46 最下位だけは何としても避けたい来世石願望者の図
世界一の顔面は、パンストをかぶってもかっこいい説 ユンギのダンスって、なぜかあまり注目されないけど、私は個人的にすごく好きです（（（どうでもいい？）
ユンギがでっかくVって書いてある服着てるの7度見くらいした（）
"0:50   バンタンあるある "" いじる時もキレッキレ """
3:59 元々はすごくイケメンなんです 4:24 ほら
3:52　ここ破くのかと思ったwww
1:07「じゃあ！！」 爺かわよ
1:05のゆんちゃんの表情好き じゃあっ！って何可愛すぎだってば笑
4:01ナムさんwww 4:10無理、息させてまじww
1:06の爺やの顔が甘すぎて溶けた 世界中の女の子みんな惚れてしまうくらい可愛いスマイル
ユンギが前半元気なのに後半お疲れなのが爺感ただよっててたまらん笑 Vの服がテテラブなのかな？と妄想してしまう…末期かな……
このときのユンギめっちゃテンション高かったよねwwwみんな高いけど。
1:47 みゅーじっくすたーとぅからの 棒立ちすたーとぅ可愛いwww
なんかジミンが司会って珍しくない？
結局ユンギさんに勝てる ホビペンはいないのです。 ホビペン代表ユンギさんです(笑)
3:32 自分用
0:43 ちょっとだけどテヒョン氏のエアガム頂きました。
爺のダンスにみんなめっちゃ喜んでるの可愛い笑笑笑笑
グクテテの「ふぅあっwwあうっwwうぁっww」みたいな笑い声じわる
最初のテテとホビの顔ジワルw いっつも思うけど編集最高過ぎんか？w
ゆんたんww 怒るくせに、ガチで踊ってくるの可愛いかよww 最後のなむちとててやばいwwwww
ホビが褒められて照れちゃうところくっそ可愛い❤
2:19 いただきます😘
アイドルしてるバンタンも、芸人してるバンタンも全部全部愛してるよ！ ちゃこさんも愛してるよ！ 最近ちゃこさんへの愛しか叫んでない笑笑
こん時のホビの前髪が目にかかってる感じ闇ホソクぽくて好きが溢れる。
ユンちゃん普通に上手いて
この時のホソクのビジュ めっちゃ好きだけど特に 1:50からのホソクめっちゃかっこいい
え、ユンギ…2:05舌…え？？？？？やべぇ爺だ()
シュガヒョン罰ゲームありだと必死になるのもう可愛すぎてwwww

ナムさんとテテのパストン被った顔ツボなんですけどww
パンスト被ったナムさんとテテめっちゃ面白いけどそれも可愛く思えるのは何故だ
シンガポールの人です！！さっきは質問にたくさん応えてくれて、ありがとうございました！ 動画最高でした\(＾∇＾)/
テテがパンスト被った時、顔の小ささがすごい

Que hermoso 💕!!!!! *c muere muridamente*
O-M-G awwwwwwwwwwww 🥰
So cute jimin And jin
Jungkook ♥️
You REALLY need to watch a live performance of this as well.
"Since you didn’t see the full practice video, they played rock paper scissors to see who would do Hobi’s part during the choreography and unfortunately Suga lost; so the attempted twerk-dancing was Suga tryging to do Hobi’s part."
"And that was the minimal pelvic thrusting. They are MUCH more powerful in their live performances on the move. The first time I saw them live, RM popped at the camera so aggressively that I shrieked out loud. And I'm in my 50s. 🥴"
PLSSSS WATCH JIMIN AND JUNGKOOK DANCE TO COMING OF AGE😭❤️
"When Yoongi danced, it was so cute 🥺 thats why he's my mans-"
Jungkookkkkkkkkkkkkk
You should watch 'Baepsae Explained by a Korean'🙏 It's super informative because Baepsae's lyrics are pretty deep and there are lots to know about the song
"I still have a crush on that RM and yeas, Hobi is the shining star of that performace... g that man"
RM~ sooo handsome and cute~~~~~~~~~
Fun fact: Suga lost a bet on rock paper scissors and had to do a dance near the end part of this video 😁😁😁💜💜💜
Finally someone who also does the math on JKs age before watching lol
“RM looks like a baby- oH??”😭
"I think, the most iconic video is the Dimple + Pied Piper live on the Fifth Munster"
Jungkook outfit in this 🔥🔥
Please do the LIVE performance version 2016 japan and the Baepsae explained by a Korean.
"Ye, the hip, and everything... But when u will watch the DKDKTV explained by a Korean video... Your mind will explode... So strong meaning this song! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Every one notices Jimins dancing and not  j hopes. It’s weird. Given he also has a dancing back ground.
Please do the Baepsae Explained by a Korean by DKDKTV.
Please watch Baepsae live performance. That's wiiilllddd 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I recommend you to watch Dope + Baepsae + Fire + Run medley live performance (on Wembley Concert or Speak Yourself The Final Tour Seoul)
"Here is a change in pace. check our this animated clip from BigHit called Tinytan The song they used in the clip is called ""00:00"".  Just in case you need the translation to the song for the animation has no subtitling until the end of the footage.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7BMF0ozFS0  enjoy!"
"Show her the live performances especially the concerts compilation of Baepsae 💪💜  And i agree with you. But i think the hyungs is not talked about much because they dont get as much screen time as the maknaes. That's because if they perform, the choreo is normally done in a way that the person singing/rapping will take the spotlight/middle. So with most of their songs, the rapline will only get that spotlight/middle part/screen time probably once or twice depending on the song, but the maknaes get it alot due to them being vocalists where the chorus and melodies are commonly/mostly taking 75% of a song.   But! If you see their concerts! You will appreciate ALL of them individually! Because you will see how much more swag from the Hyungs that you've missed out from the screen. And you will leave the concert with JHope being your bias or bias wrecker 🤣"
BTS 영상이 조금씩 보이더니 이젠 몇년전 뱁새까지 찾아보는 언니들이네...어서와~~~...ㅋㅋ
This video V became my bias wrecker....🥰
cute RM ♡
Always a classic 🙌🤯
"You may want to check out ""Explained version of BAPSAE by Korean"" to appreciate more of their interpretation dance and the song.  ""Bapsae explained by Korean"" by DKDKTV"

جونكوك قال بسم الله
استغفر الله. 🌚
استغفر الله. 🌚 اصلا ما اصدق انو جونغكوك مسلم 😭😭⁦❤️⁩⁦❤️⁩
ممكن تشابه في النطق محسيتش انه قال بسم الله وبعدين فرضا قالها هدا مايعنيش انه مسلم ونتمنى ربي يهديه ويهدي بتس كلهم
جونغكوك قال بسم الله كفو BTS كفو تاي و جونغكوك 💜💜💜💜💜💚💚💚💚💚🐇🐇🐇🐇🐰🐰🐰🐰بس ماتوقعت من BTS بس بسمله ماشاء لله على يهم🕋🕋🕋🕋🕋🕋🕋🕋🐰🐰🐇🐇💜💜💜💚💚💚💚
نعم جونكوك كم من مر يثول بسم الله  وما شا الله  و الله
هناك مقاطع يقول فيها أيضا السلام عليكم، و واحد كان جالسا فيه مع تاي و قال في كلامه بصوت مرتفع: ما شاء الله!! و السلام أثناء الجنازة، حقيقة لست ارمي أو كيبوبية بل اوتاكو لكنني مع هذا قد أكون سعيدة، على كل الأمر ليس موضحاً هنالك إحتمالية 80% إلى 90% أنه سيقتل إذا عرفوا بالأمر لا سمح الله!!
منصدقش  جنغوكوك مسلم😲😲
جونغكوك قال بسم الله يعني مسلم هاذا توقعي
هوه يقول( باسِميدا) لكن كانه يقول بسم الله🙃
بس جونغكوك حاط وشم وهذه اكبر غلطه والله ما يسامحه الا اذا جونغكوك سار يصلي و يدعي الى الله وما يدعي لاي احد غير الله
انا احب كوك اذا كان مسلم او غير مسلم انا اااااحبههه
منو جان سكران بذاك الفديو جونغكوك يمكن مو وسلم
يعني زوجي كوك و اخي تاي مسلمين روعة 🔥
جنغكوك قال بسم الله
بسم الله حكى والله ياريت يا جونغكوك
👏😍😍❤️❤️
استمري
حلووو
ناايس
ياجماعة كوك مسلم انا شفت كزا فيديو مو بس كلمة( بسم الله) في كتير كلمات قالها* *
منجد سمعت الله انا ولا عقلي فيه شي؟ ؛-؛
قولي هذا مزاح هو قال بسم الله ان شاء الله كل اعضاء كون مسلمين نفرح
قالها والله حتى قالها
اتوقع هو يقول هاسميدا 🙂😂
جونغكوكي مسلم
لا حول ولا قوة الا بالله
ما الا يكون مسلم يمكن عم يجرب و الله يهدي وهو حتى لو راح ياسلم ماراح يقول لأحد لانوا الشركه ما بتقبل
في كلمات بالكوري بس احنا مصرين ان نسمعها بالعربي      فهمتو   و انا ارمي مو هيتر
ترا مو كل وحد يقول بسم الله مسلم لزم يصلي و يصوم ألشهر كمل و يعبد الله
والله مادري شعبر 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🐰🐰🐰🐰🥺 كوكي مسلم
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂متت
هذي الحلقه قديمه قبل انعرف مو مسلم  يعني كل هل وشم صر مسلم ولا يشرب كحول اعيد وكرر جنكوك مو مسلم لو انا قلت لو كان مسلم كان هو بنفسه اعلن انه مسلم  فهتو ارمي  وبس والله 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 ارمي وفتخر اوني استمري 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍💜💜💜💜💜💜
آرمي تتذكرون لما BTS صامو رمضان 😭😭😭😭😭💖
يعجبني الفيديوا 😂
يعجبني الفيديوا 😂
لا اظن لان توجد فديوهات عم يسكر
لا هو في لمرة الأولى قال سيميدا وتاني ماقال بإسم الله أصلا جونغكوك لايملك ديانة
اصلا عادي
بالله حيرتيني 😧😧😧😧
اول مقطع أساساً ما قال بسم الله قال اوه ابسميدا و التاني مو متاكده 🙂
قال بسم الله 💓🥰🥰
Wow هذا حقيقي ٪100😘
كوك ال بسم الله بس منو مسلم حلكن تفهمو انو كل أعضاء بي تي اس منون مسلمين
بجوز مسلم هو نشالله يكون مسلم بس كمان بجوز عنده صديق وقله انو قبل ما ياكل او يعمل شي يقول بسم الله ومن هيك صار يقولها بس نشالله يكون مسلم
لا هذه كلمة من لهجة بسم الله  وهي بسمندون
💖💖💖💖
الله يزقك عقل حبيبتي😭💔
هذه صدم قوي😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
مقلش بسم الله
"يا جماعه مش معناها لما هو قال ""بسم الله"" يبقا مسلم هو اصلا مش مسلم صدقوني لو هو مسلم كل الارميز العرب اكيد هيبقوا عرفين بس والله مش مسلم و كمان الناس هتقول علاقوا مش فاهمين🙄😴"
يمكن تكون كلمه كوريه ولا حاجه
الثالثه
احلام العصر
جونغكوك مش مسلم   كانت  أحدي الاختبارات في مدارس اندونسيا  والمعلمه حطه صوره جنكوك ومعلمات عنه  وغيرت الديانه والهيترز لما صدقو قصو الصوره ونشروها  بس جونغكوك مش مسلم ارمي
أن كان مسلم رائع وان لم يكن مسلما رائع لكم دينكم ولي ديني
ههههههه
لا هوه اصله مسيحي جوز يشوف الفيدهوات السلام ويقول مثنه شدكولون اي يا لا 😜😜😜😜
احم احم جاج بلحم جونغكوك موش داري بنا ولا بلفتشوب تعنا
اول شي منو مسلم هني قالو انو ماحدا من بي تي اس مسلم انا يلا بنزل شي كذب مبعملو لايك ول اشترك كهرباء ههههههههه ليكي بتي ننزل لليسا من فرقة بلاك بينك صور
لا هو مو نسلم لانو كم مرة شرب الخمر
ههههههههههههه يشرب كحول مسلم بس يارب  كلامك صحيح
بشرب خمر كيف مسلم
جونكوك مش مسلم هو بدون ديانة  بس يأمن بوجود  الرب    انا كورية  و هيدا شي يلي منسمعوا   كتير  كل اعضاء  فرقة bts  بدون  ديانة  يأملون بالرب  انا نامجون  ملحد و يمكن صار بدون ديانة لونوا ب لايف  عل waver قل  i thank God that we are living in 2021  يعني اشكر ربي اننا    مازلنا  نعيش  في 2021
🤔🤔🤔🤔
كيف مسلم و بيشرب خمر
جنغكوك مو مسلم أن شاء الله يصير مسلم ادعو😭🙏
كيف يعني مسلم 😂😂😂😂 لا اكيد
لا مب مسلم
ههههههههههههههه لا تدورين مشاهدات براس gungkook Okay هو موووووووو مسلممممممم خطيه قليل عنده وشوم بجسمه 😤😤😤😤😤
بدون ما اشوف الفديو اكيد لا لان المسلم ما يعرض جسمه بالمسرح ويرقص ويهز ويشرب خمر وعنده وشوم وهو اصلا ملحد 😂
لا هو ليس مسلم لأنه إذا تذكرتم أن لديه وشم ومحرم الو شم في الإسلام (لعن الله المستوصلين و المستوصلات و الواشمين و الواشمات ) و لاكن كان من الجيد جدا اذا كان مسلما و انا أتمنى الخير لهم جميعا. مع السلامه 😊👋

"Who else has been watching Sungha Jung grow up? :"")"
"He's a master technician, combining bass + rhythm + harmonic lead + backbeat... but on top of all that he's got soul"
"For some reason, I feel that the guitar is singing, it doesn't feel like someone is playing it as an instrument but instead, it feels like that he made the instrument come to life."
You know it's a good cover when you can hear the lyrics
It'll almost be nine years that i'm a fan... So proud that i've watched him grow into such an amazing person. ❤️ Will and always be by your side.
"No matter how bad my day has been, it becomes better when sungha uploads"
Im not a bts fan but i like this song it makes me relax and chill especially you play it on guitar 😙😙😙 i wish i can play like him to 😉😉😉
I'm a big fan from Philippines 🇵🇭
He's extraordinarily good... Dont know why but people can't make guitar sound exactly the same as he does.. Even if the guitar is same as his... People can't ❤️❤️❤️
"""정성하의 손톱 때"""
"I love how you played Suga's ""mm mm mm""🥺"

You never cease to amaze me! You are so talented! Thank you for arranging this song for us.

"Finally! Thanks for cover this song, i love it, borahae💜"
Was seriously waiting for u to perform this one... 💜
I purple youu 💜
The Korean word 'Michinom (미친놈)' is a bit more rough expression than the 'crazy guy' 😭
They are adults... not 5 year old kids. It shouldn't be a big deal bout Jimin cussing
I don’t think “crazy guy” is a bad word . I think it is just what people say normally and doesn’t affect anyone
BTS are grown men. They can curse sometimes.
"Why is this a big deal? He’s literally 25. Also, the fact that Jimin thinks ‘crazy guy’ is a swear is adorable not gonna to lie./y’all nvm apparently he said something different but still, not a big deal."
"Jimin: ""cruses on accident"" Army (some fans): THATS ILLEGAL SEND HIM TO JAIL"
Since when is “crazy guy” a curse word?  Am I missing something?  Even the context of which it was said was light hearted.
"Bruh calm down, it was a mistake, he said he would never curse but since it was difficult he just said a curse and he didn't mean to... No hate just saying. Luv you guys"
"They're humans. Not robots, obviously they'll curse. Everyone curses whether they admit it or not, and they should be free to do whatever they want, say whatever they want. They're not 5 year olds... Don't make a big deal out if this. 😒"
Meanwhile Namjoon: yeh f**k that I ain't just doing mah thing Do you do you do you do the f**k you want
Me at the age of 14 cursing   Him: an adult just saying crazy   Me: oh f
Jimin cursing is adorable I do curse sometimes and I’m super young it’s just something that slips of the tongue easy
"Crazy Guy? That's it? Poor Jimin....if he heard my potty mouth, he would be in the ER lol"
It'd be nice if everyone cursed as jimin does 😂
Finally im early. And Jimin swearing. I thought that was Jungkook Namjoon and Sugas thing.
By the title I can’t tell it’s gonna be good
"Jimin always say ""Army don't say bad words"" or ""Don't say that"" etc.....But our mochi is so innocent 🤧 I curse a LOT! and when I see BTS I'm a saint lol 🤭"
"They are literally in their 20s it's not a big deal, their just human, like us😭"
Wait he’s never cursed in camera before?
"Nah, I'm sure they cuss off cam they're only humans like us.  Suga even cusses on cam (though BH editors censored it) and even in his songs. In RUN BTS 121 when Jimin was asked by Jhope to get the other pair of the slipper that matches the footprint found beside the army headstone, Jimin gave a death stare to Jhope and Jin said ""I guess he's cursing with his eyes"" lol 😅"
*JIMIN AHHHHHHHHHHH* SO CUTEEEEEEEEEEE
BTS r literally the definition of perfect eventhough they have cursed in the past   Do u agree?
*Sees Notification* O GOD ITS HAPPENING!
"*Hi my dear army's,* *Iam back to home from hostel for Sankranti festival holidays.* *Iam going to stay in home for a week. So I will enjoy this week with BTS videos*"
This is not the first time he cursed. Y’all acting like the “Jiminie pabo” moment AHL doesn’t exist-
"since when''crazy guy''is a bad word i think people are just overeacting,actually jimin is so cute with everything he does."
AwHhh! 💜 Jimin is adorable that word wasn't even that bad 👎 😁💜💜💜💜😘
He didn't cursed but the moves made him difficult to do so😅
Jungkook: may I sing savage love?
Jimin cursing is the holliest thingy in my life♡♡♡
Meanwhile Jin scolding Suga and Rap Monsterrrrttrrr
"I would pay money to hear/see them swear, I’m in love with swear words-"
I'm not suprised many kids now a days cursed more than him🤣
"Is ""Crazy Guy"" a cussing world why is he even Embarassed Thats sooooo Cuteee  💜💜🥺"
Hey just know u are perfect💜💜💜
Is crazy guy such a bad word???like i sometimes call my dad & bro that things ..u know😅😅😆😆😆
This can also give haters a chance you know? They can easily use the “children watch their content???”
Some people forget that they are grown men. It was just a curse word lol
"I remember when gguk saigd  'O man holy sh!t', '시발/fvck' and the 'fcks' in savage love Omg they look so cute when the curse, only rm is the sexiest when he curse"
Also me having a playlist where other idols cursing....
Jimin Cursing? I am here for it 😝💜
"His unnecessary embarrassment from swearing just makes it that much more hilarious... don't worry Jimin, you're allowed to swear, you're definitely mature enough 😂"
Is that even an abusive word to start with? That shows how much jimin is an angel.. wow borahe
me: *thinking this would be a funny video when jimin said beach and tae mistook it as b*** * ARMY's only know this iconic meme
"Jimin: ""Crazy guy"" People: So you choosed dead"
Jimin actually dropped the f boom on American hustle in 2014. He was working with RM on a song for a challenge and a line in the song was “I don’t give a fk”
"Crazy Guy? Jimin takes that as a curse, that just explain how sweet he is 💜💜😢"
There's no need to freak out Jimin is 25 why can he not curse sometimes?
i dont think ''crazy guy'' is a bad word but jimin  thinking its a swear word is adorable not gonna lie
"You know what have pissed me off when ""Agust D D-2"" came out? Actually it was one of the things. Some ARMYs saying that said that Yoongi cursed too much in his ""Agust D"" and ""Agust D D-2"" albums. Luckily most of us started trending the hashtag #Yoongicursemore"
He's cursing is also so cuteeee The way he covered his mouth😂🥺 But from when crazy guy became a curse word tho
I never knew that “crazy” is a curse word😂😂😂...i use it almost every time
Kinda thought he was gonna say something else but it’s still pretty cute 🥰😅
He really is the most adorable human ever! 💜
CRAZY GUY ISNT CURSING WORD IT ISNT BAD WORD THOUGH ITS FINE TO USE CURSEING WORDS FOR JIMIN AS HE RARELY USES ITS LIKE SHOOTING STAR
Me using all shorts of course words.  My friends... That's it 🤨 Jimin curse word ..crazy  My friends... Oh my god😱 LOL😂
JIMIN LOVE YOU SO MUCH FOREVERMORE ALWAYS
"Our mochi is so sweet, ""crazy man"" is not even a curse word, but he took it so seriously and was embarrassed. Armies will always stand by ALL the 7 members, even if they change because we know in their and our hearts, we will always love them!"
"Jimin can curse like anyone and I bet it will sound innocent, also this is how you know he’s so innocent 😭 crazy guy is not a curse word 😂 so cute"
He is so cute  Always shine jiminshi
오빠 thinks “crazy guy” is a curse word?!!!? AWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Its no big deal..sometimes we randomly say some words in out of excitement but we don't realy mean it..they are just playing. No big deal so don't worry 💜💜💜
"""The Dream Chapter: Magic"" on the wall caught my attention, my bois TXT being there by telepathy."
"Idk how many remember this, JK went “oh man holy shit” when Jin had wasabi...so, duh. Cursing comes out normally, it ain't smthng blasphemous...calm down my daughtereu!!"
"Lmao I’m 15 and I curse like 24/7, and jimin is 25"
~meanwhile~ Rap Line: **intentionally cursing in literally every solo song they have** Jungkook: oh man holy shit! V: Bitch? Jin: aah fuck
"He's so cute. No big deal, Jiminie. 💜💜💜"
Honestly though sometimes I don’t understand how stars keep all the things they want to say under control  it’s unimaginable! If I were them and I had to face some obnoxious “fan” I would lose control lol
WHY IS THIS SO CUTE!🥰🥰
I can’t believe I'm some minutes late😭
Is crazy gug even a curse word?? But our jimin in so cut. The word is not even cursing and he is so embarised of saying it. So cute😳😳😳   Edit : I even curse sometime it is common to humans. 😁😁
Crazy guy Is it a curse? 😂😂😂😂  Actual curses are RM's Joke and Throw It lol 😂😂
"If we want vlives and candid moments with Bangtan, then we shouldn't make a fuss and drama over every little thing they do and say.  They're going to go more and more secretive, the more fuss that's made over this stuff.  We barely see them on vlive and twt as it is."
"ARMY fans are not just  young adults and older , they have young kids that are preschoolers eg William and Bentley, they are well aware if it. Cursing does not make you cool, nor an adult. They are humans like us, so here and there a word might slip out."
this video be me in a nutshell-
Our baby mochiiiii    Cursed for the first time-
Jimin is always cute.whatever he does
This whole thing just reminded my of 'OH MAN HOLY SHIT' lol :D
Am I the only one who's concerned about the size difference between Jimin and Jin's shoulders..?
I love you so much Jimin
Like his blonde hair I think they have worked hard during COVID. Trying new looks music dance a whole new vibe . I think a big drop is coming. I have read how groomed they are but when jimin sneezed in one interview and said something he said seemed hilarious wish I new what it was 💜💜💜🌍🙏🏼
I remember watching this live- I was sneaking during an online class and I kept giggling- 1. The curse 2. Jimin holding the phone in the wrong hand which kept making him have a low score
Bts may look like kids but they are almost in their 30s they can cuss all they want i think hearing them cuss is adorable espeically when they say it in English cause of their Korean accent
But jimin is so cute when saying those words...ooooh....I  love jimin❤️❤️❤️
*Even his cursing is so CUTE and ADORABLE* 😍 Saranghaeyo mochi 💜 Good morning from India 💜🇮🇳💜
Oop-
"So he said 미친 놈 which sounds like Minchi-nom means Crazy Bastard. Suga says it in song Augst D but BigHit put up a sub that says ""freakin crazy"" LOL yeah some of us know Korean"
According to jimin: Crazy guy is  Cursed word  Jungkook : Am i joke to you🙄 have you listen savage love  👁👄👁
These are grown men. Honestly 💛 he's a person too
Since when is crazy guy a curse word 😂😂 Oh Jimin 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I thought jimin was cursed during the live😂
Too cute ... Jimin!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Jimin...?  This video was amazing! ^●^
Our little Mochi is an adult 😂 so what if he cussed
They were the cutest that day! Jiminie in particular have been extremely sweet and ... ugh! I just love him OK?! He's my bias after all. BTS marry me please!
Finallyyyyyyy!!                  ~Jungkook
I saw the v live it’s not a curse word in Korean as far as I know even If it is no big deal all of BTS are adults now and curse sometimes lots of people do.
He's cute tho~🥺
I honestly don’t see a problem with him swearing. He’s old enough to make his own decisions and we ARMY need to know that. Jimin doesn’t need to be watched a criticised for everything he does 24/7 so just leave him alone and let him live his life without making him stress over all the little things he does or says. #idolslivesmatter
I find him adorable 😘
"jungkook: ""the guy in the back is me.""   he even kicked at the last part...😂"

"Que talento de esta Chica Dios mío!!!!,saludos desde CHILE 🇨🇱 , último  país al sur del mundo (Sud América).."
An angel who plays violin just came down to earth!
Now this is what I call T A L E N T
"When taehyung ask army to post #아미가치는클래식 challenge on twitter, I remember one of army upload this girl covering bwl. We know taehyung saw it, and this dynamite cover, I love it!!!!"
Prisoners: why are you here? Me: because I killed the repeat button! 😝
"Все мы хором танцевали, Лайки ставить успевали!..💃🏻🕺🏻🎸❄️🇷🇺"
"im not the only one who watched the guy with black shirt at the back 😂  100% he is an army , he even kicked at the first part of jk and at the last part of the video 💜"

I LOVE VIOLIN VERSION 💜💜💜 THANKS KAROLINA WE LOVE YOU 💖💖
Tiene mucho talento ✨Y más por Dynamite ❤👌
One question 🤔 HOW DO YOU DANCE AND PLAY THE VIOLIN AT THE SAME TIME!!!??!!??
I hope BTS it's like it but i too 😄💕👍😍  I love when you it's the violin playing 💕❤😍👍
"let's be honest , we all singing this in silent"
So the new duet song is gonna be dynamite   🤩🤩.
You are really god gifted Your parents are very lucky that they have a daughter like you
No one:    Not a soul:   Me: Wondering if any army is out their with her *secretly watching :)
Dude in the back dancing got me dead
I  continue to be a fan of your mastery of the violin music but am also happy that your parents are teaching you to use your voice too as you grow. One person that has very powerful voice like yours is a 14 year old that was on American Got Talent and her name is Charlotte Summers...you and Barvina should both try to listen to her sing being you are all about the same age. Some of her songs are on UTUBE if you have never heard her yet and get a chance to listen to her!! It maybe helpful for you too! You young girls  have been blessed with such remarkable talent! Keep up the hard work! America loves you all!
00:22 Tgat guys just vibing  LOL Amazing 🤩
Thanks for your music and talent!! 고마워요 ^^

I love how she dances to the music
"P.S. I’m a 62 yr old mom who became a BTS fan during COVID. My mom was a musician with perfect pitch and would have been 100yrs old last week. Her instruments were her voice, the piano and violin. She had eclectic taste in music and passed that on to me. The perfect pitch was simply a phenomena"

"He really is the cutest. I hate to bias but actually I think credit goes to all members and staff who really took the time with JK. They helped him explore all his talents and you see the support he had during this what must have been grueling for a teenager. But he is happy, great sense of humor, caring and thoughtful. That is no easy feat in their industry. So congratulations to all who helped as well ."

"I’m 74 and became interested in BTS about 2 years ago. Because of illness I never enjoyed teenage obsession with pop/rock stars. I’ve come pretty late! This is my third lockdown and because of my age and health, I never go out. Technology is my saviour. I love looking at YouTube channels with BTS - every day! Thank you for working hard to do this for fans. BTS are such professionals compared to many Western groups. The combination of music genres in one song is so exciting. The dancing is fantastic, such synchronisation and originality. The sets are amazing. The singing is superb. Thank you. Keep safe."
"I am a 61 year old female from the United States. I am currently suffering from the COVID virus. Yes, it has been a difficult year but with the love and support put forth by BTS and, of course ARMY, myself and many others have made it through. To just say thank you doesn't seem like enough. Knowing that the boys struggled right along with us but kept going is so touching. Watching this recap of all the accomplishments of BTS and ARMY brings me to tears. But they are not tears of sadness they are tears of joy. All my love to BTS and ARMY, you are very important to me."
"I'm a mother, a grandma of 50 years old and I love BTS. Since the Beatles I never stand a group but BTS is the best 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
BTS and ARMY are the only things that made life bearable in 2020.
"More than anything, more than the recognition and accolades Bangtan Sonyeondan have received, it is their strength, tenacity and hearts of gold that stood out. They recognized their influence and stood up as the leaders that they truly are. They rose beyond their own doubts, fears and anxieties and pulled themselves together to create music that showed their vulnerability and sincerity. Emotionally weary as they were, they gave the world incomparable performances and gave the best of themselves.  2020 is a year that this generation will never forget because it brought the whole world to a halt. Army or not, you cannot ignore the fact that the Bangtan boys turned a chaotic year into an exciting one.  This is the BTS golden era indeed."
They were probably the busiest artists last year and we were the busiest fandom. Can't imagine what my life would have been like without them. They really helped me get through difficult times last year.
2020 was my first year as an Army and it was the best year of my life. Thank you for an amazing video to bring all the great memories back!!!
"BTS is the best artist of this century and no one   will be able to surpass or even duplicate all the achievements and contributions they have given us. Of course, no fan club can ever surpass what ARMY’s have done and will continue to do - all for the love and care and adoration for BTS. 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 SARANGHAE!"
even corona virus didn't hold their busy schedule in 2020.
BTS singlehandedly saved 2020 for so many of us.  They are legends.💜
BTS - Busiest personalities in 2020.💜
"I m an army as of 15th November, and in the last few months i found comfort and joy in their music, performances and simply in the person the are. I'll love and respect BTS for as long as I live. Thank you @US BTS ARMY for this amazng video <3 <3"
Everyone : 2020 is worst ever year in life due to pandamic  Me : 2020 is best ever year in my whole life due to BTS   💜Army💜
Wow when BTS says they were busy they really were. This doesn't even show all the behind the scenes stuff that goes into all of this. Practices and making a whole album creating the videos. They worked hard this year even without touring. Congratulations 👏 👏
RM said it and RM is rarely mistaken: Jungkook's English is so cuuute !
Wow wow wow wow wow!!!! This compilation of BTS's 2020 is amazing! Thank you to your team for creating this! This documentary video deserves more views and likes ( #BTSARMY where are you?)! Everything in it are facts and BTS are such hardworking artists and this video-proof reflected all. @USBTSARMY did a splendid job here! Borahae and stay safe 💜
"Although I love your music and your dancing, what attracted me to BTS more than anything is their kindness and decency to not just each other, but to the world.  I have lived through the last 4 years wondering what has happened to my great country.  Unable to understand how Americans can support and defend a monster like Donald Trump who is the exact opposite of what America is all about.  BTS has literally gotten me through the devastating reality that just under half of my country has been faking patriotism.  I lived in Korea a very long time ago and I have always seen the goodness in our Korean friends, but BTS has once again given me hope that there is still unselfishness and kindness out there. BTS has saved my faith in mankind and I will forever be grateful and love them for that...Thank you is not enough."
Thank you for putting this together. This was great!
2020 is the best year for Army and bts💜✨Thank you BTS always made my day happy even in quarantine 😘
2020 was BTS year.
If not for BTS 2020 will be harder to live and carry on. They are angels comforting the world in hard times.
Thanks for the BTS Documentary of 2020💜💜💜
"I guess when what you sincerely stand for and advocate as a group of talented caring young people is real and relevant, then silence will only serve to magnify it, and in darkness, whatever light is available, brighten it. 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 #BTS2020AndBeyond"
I think BTS have a whole building to keep their trophy........
They didn’t rest in 2020 😳😰😍
They touch my heart like no other.
What a wonderful memory created in year 2020 with the existence of BTS💜. I'm so grateful 🙏. Thanks for this videos 😍
"This is such an extensive list of what BTS has given to us this year! Everyone should be very grateful that they really love what they do and that's why ARMYs are born! They gave most of the contents for free for us so we should be thankful that they ( BH & tannies) take their crafts and their fans very seriously with respect and love so for those that is always demanding that their artist do this and do that , should just watch contents presented by them first before they say anything. We don't need anyone ""saving"" the boys or anything. They chose their own life choices and they are doing this because they love it and they love us. So stop using words like m**treatm*** or shit like that. The boys are multi millionaires that have shares in the company and have their own say (if you watched their Vlives and YT or any of their reality shows) so the choices are theirs.  Eventhough they make us feel like we're friends , it does not give you the right to talk over them. Especially grown men.  Just wanted to put it out there to the newer fans that has just started stanning BTS last year or this year.  Please watch their Vlives or their Bon voyage or their docuseries or even Run BTS to get to know the boys better. And for those who needs help from and veteran armys , you can always go to twitter and go through some twitter that are neutral armys and ask!   lastly, THANK YOU UA BTS ARMY FOR DOING THIS VIDEO!! VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND LOVE THIS SO MUCH!  And i'm sorry for the rant! Just wanted to put it our there for people who are new or for people who are disguising as armys to shit on bangtan."
"BTS's work ethic is inspiring. They almost always seem to be creating or brainstorming even on their ""breaks"".  Seven minds, working together...they appear more poised and relaxed too, which comes thru in their performances.  👏 👏 👏 BTS!"
BTS and ARMY are amazing!!!!
The Greatest BTS 👍♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🥰👏👏👏👏

"Thank you for wonderfully made video. Lived my 2020 again with it...  But overall it is terrible how much BTS had to work in 2020, in 2019 they had some holiday, now it seems that from some month (maybe June) they didn't have a single free day. I hope they will get at least some rest in 2021..."
Thank you for this collection of one of the toughest year for many. Thankfully we had BTS to get us through it.

Thank you, thank you for your talent, humor, and music. You work so hard for us...........i love evey single one of you and your hearts of gold!"
GOD damnit I'm sad now :(
"This was a great doc! But I would be remiss if I didn't call out the fact that you showed clips of the MMA Black Swan, ON, and LGO performances but somehow missed the Iconic Dynamite Dance Break. haha. Anyway, thank you for making this! I like that you included the stats and records!"
They had the BEST performances this year! Nothing is going to change my mind.

Thank you for this. Get a sense of what all happened in our BTS ARMY Universe
I'm 44 and been a fan of BTS for awhile now and they are my absolute favorite group. They are so positive and just really lift me up. I'm always happy when I listen to their music. They are so fun and charming. You can't help but smile watching them and their crazy antics. They are bringing ppl together and spreading positive energy. I just love  them!
"Let's all do our part in 2021, so we can get back to live concerts & fun with our babies, BTS. ""BE"" happy & productive; ""Life goes on"" when never giving up. So, people let's get it done... let's go!!! You're worth it & BTS too."
Even with the pandemic they have achieved so much. 💜
I am 63 and The last boy group I was really in to was the Beetles. I found BTS in 2014 and was so enthralled with them
"Thank you for this! I discovered them in late October, so it’s nice to see all the things they did in 2020."
Thank you dear ARMY for bringing me in to this wonderful world of BTS 💜❤️
I am 51 yrs old and I love these boys !! I will always cherish the day my daughter was listening to them and I came out bc of what she was listening to and she said it's BTS like I knew who they were and in just one song they won my heart and made my daughter and I even closer than ever !! Thank you BTS for ur words of strength and love you will never know what you all have done for me on a personal level!!!
I am 68 years of age and I am here - that is all I need to say about my love for BTS.
"One day in lockdown 2020 I heard singularity, I wondered who it was that was singing... and the rest is history 😆💜"
Wow this is a great recap.🤩 BTS is great💜🎉👏
The pandemic didn't stop their massive growth. They still got a very busy year. Way to go BTS! We love you. 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜

Can we just all agree that this is the best trio ever?
Der Corona Mindestabstand wurde aber nicht eingehalten😅😂😂
"If we all had dancing guy's aura, the world would be more fabulous."
If anyone says anything negative about our beloved Dancing Guy. It is because you are jealous you can't dance like him in front of 50 people or in front of nobody. He is really what we wish we could do but very few of us can ❤️😊
As an army and saxophone player... I’m loving this 😄
"They are fantastic together❤️I hope to see more videos like this :)  The dancing guy 🕺made my day, he dances very cool and is a happy person☺️❤️"
did he pay the dance guy? so chemistry i guess.🙌🏻
lets just say the dancing and the song was a *blast*
Everyone would agree that this guy showed us how attractive a saxophonist can be.

Dancing guy and Daniele = epic

"I listen to this mans sax when tired, bored or angry"
I remember first video I saw with the “dancing guy “ I felt the love from Daniele I’m happy the way the friendship panned out
"We are in the rhythm, so much that we want to dance. In addition, the dancer is also in the rhythm. Beware of DYNAMITE on a bridge, it can explode ! 😂"
"Siamo nel ritmo, così tanto che abbiamo voglia di ballare. Inoltre, il ballerino è anche nel ritmo. Fai attenzione alla DYNAMITE su un ponte, può esplodere!   😂"
wow!! you’re so great~! I’m Korean and my brother is saxophonist !!! I hope someday you and my bro will play together!!!!!!!
Now I'm waiting for your crossover with the epic sax guy
"The dancing boy makes me cry 😢 Thanks, Daniele !"
I think his saxophone sound goes well with this song.
"Please play ""iron man 3"" theme with karolina protsenko and alone also. 🙏Request.    Your songs and duets make me feel good and forget all miseries. Love you 3000"
Danièle Vitale + bts + dynamite = Best song 😍😍😍😍😍😍

The guy and Daniele... wonderful!!!! 😍❤️
Hi from Georgia❤🇬🇪
I had to rewatch the Jin video portion to double check... but Jin said that he was eating 2 packages of 2 chicken (aka 4 chicken breasts) per day.  Congratulations on being able to survive on 2 chicken breasts per day though for 3 days... I cannot fully grasp how hard it actually was.
You don’t have to lose weight you’re literally perfect 😍💕💜💕
Imagine jin did that for a whole year 😭😖🥺 poor jin
"OMG I’M NOT EVEN A FAN BUT UNNIE, YOU’RE SO PRETTY!! 🤩💖"
"Hey beautiful! Jin has unbelievable focus, determination and self discipline. Precisely why I stan him as my ultimate bias."
entertainment: crazy strict diets rules  me : okay im going to lose weight!  my life: you dont have to go on a diet girl just eat what i told you to eat. also me: my mom doesnt let me to go on a diet 🙂
I gained so much weight because of covid/staying home 😂 and I’ve been doing intermittent fasting! I agree! Camera make our faces Bigger!!!😤🤪
"And he was only sleeping 4 hours a day and dancing, practicing, rehearsing, shooting video, promoting, and doing concerts. That how he was committed, especially knowing that Jin is a foodie."
I would be like a skeleton if I did that for a whole year-
"Dieting for my face , heheheh I can totally relate. True, great respect to BTS members for  every extra mile they go on their diet and taking care of themselves. The tape measure way sounds good. Will try that. Thanks for sharing Anna."
"I’d seen some clips of Jin saying his hobby was sleep, and talking about having mental health issues...makes me wonder if he was dieting like this during that time"
"This is so encouraging but actually you don't need those diet, you look great and perfect! 💕"
Happy New Year everybody! Do you have any New Year's resolutions?? I'm personally dying for a weight training session at the gym... I want to touch metal 😭
"I get so exhausted if I skip even just one meal, I can't imagine how Anna did this for 3 days and Jin for 1 whole year."
"I taught 1 meal every day for 10 days but 1 meal in 10 days that's not extreme that pure death, pour Jimin😳😳🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺💜"
I love how you were still taking multivitamins while you were doing this! That's a drastic change just in 3 days wow!!
"Tae was talking about his trainee days, and he said he got in trouble for putting salt on his chicken breast. They would not allow the guys to ear salt! They had to eat it plain, boiled. Also, Jin said there were two breasts in a package, and he ate 2 packages a day. But think how much physical activity they do in a day. Especially in the early days.  They burned so many calories, just in their hours and hours of daily dance practice."
Jin my bias❤️
Jimin diet does work for me. My weight last time is at 100 kg now after Jimin diet my weight is at 60 kg. #ThankyouJimin
"Seeing this makes me wonder if this is why Jin said his ideal woman would be slightly chubby. Poor guy 😭 Everybody is beautiful no matter their weight/size. BigHit didn't make Jimin diet, though; he developed an eating disorder due to online bullies constantly calling him fat. Idol life isn't glamorous like it may seem from the outside looking in. It's nonstop with constant criticism both from bosses & the public alike. The relentlessly high beauty standards mixed with insane amounts of stress, a never-ending work schedule, exacting expectations/standards, and online bullying breeds mental health & body images issues (or greatly exacerbates them if they already existed before debuting/becoming famous). That's why there has been a string of idol suicides over the past few years. Idols can't even date or have personal/alone time with even just themselves at all. It's lonely at the top 😔😥 All of this is why I applaud BTS for being open about depression & mental health. They're trying to normalize a hush-hush topic, and I think that's great. They have saved a lot of lives in the process. Sorry for the novel 😂🙈"
"Those diets the idols have to go through are INSANE!! Why would anyone want to go through that :( I lost 16kg in seven months by changing my eating habits and I can PROMISE YOU the moment you stop eating sugar,, fast food and junk you automatically start losing weight!"
"I honestly felt the pain from the vlogs during the diet days. I teared up for you, and I felt sad for kpop idols. I totally understand why they do it, but food is life ☹️☹️"
Jin... Nickname world wide handsome 😆😆😆😆 nothing but facts🤣🤣
"I think this diet is suitable for those who wants to lost weight fast for special occasion for example. The menu is okay but if we want to make it as a consistent diet for more than 3 days, maybe we can add steam veggies too like broccoli or carrot for the nutrition. Avoid carbo for sure. Anyway, thanks for the video, Anna! It's great!"
"4:59 hes not even fat there thooo hez cute asf, hes just playing with his cheek on that angle---"
After hearing about your indigestion i can't imagine what jin had to go through after that 1 year of no calories 😬
"That’s the first time I saw someone doing Jin’s diet! Thank you for doing it, sharing with us, being so honest AND careful and meticulous with everything you said! 🥺💘 Actually I’m 1,57 m and my goal is to stay between 55 and 50 kgs. So when you showed yours and the boys numbers? 🤯 Even though I know the cultural difference, still... All of BTS are so determined and hardworking! They’re amazing. I can’t help but think that Jimin have an iron will, if he hadn’t such a soft and sweet heart he would be terrifying! The world would be shocked. Nowadays, whenever I see his body, especially his thighs/legs, my heart clenches. He’s beautiful, still have the Jibooty, but he has lost so much muscle that I can’t shake the feel of dread. ANYWAY, I might try that diet sometimes, 3 days seems possible to me 😅 so maybe 3 days every week, drinking lots of water, eating only chicken breast and tuna, avoiding salt, carbs and sugar... My problem will definitely be the exercises 😬 but I’ll try at least 35 minutes everyday... But before all that I need to buy some vitamins 😅"
"I did Jimin's diet and drink just water when I feel hungry last January and I almost cried out from stomach pain so after 2 weeks, I bought a looooot of eggs and noodles to eat them hahaha."
I had no idea jin did it for a year 😭 poooor jin
I feel so sad for jin😭🥺
"I feel like I have to give that information about Jimin, it wasn't a diet he was talking about his eating disorder that's not a diet do not ever try it he talked about how bad it was, he couldn't even practice at the time and how thankful he is to be able to survive... He was too young for being on a diet back then he was only 17 years old and he didn't have an adult structural face yet. But people were hating on him for his appearance and calling him ""mochi"" yes that was a horrible nickname not a cute one. Then he started eating healthier bc he fainted while practicing and the other members took care of him, then he grow up and his face changed with a healthy diet he didn't lose weight bc of that unreasonable diet... That kind of diet backlashes and people quickly gain even more than they have lost. I'm so proud of him because he talks about his situation to teach younger people to not fall in the same dark hole. I'm so proud of him it's not easy to talk about. I hope that clarifies the importance of the situation 💜"
OMG that must've felt like 3 extremely long days. Respect for doing this
"when anna unnie said stretchable face, immediately thought of TXT's Soobin :P i love u so much unnie!!💕💕"
Chopin-Prelude In E Minor Op. 28 No. 4 In E Minor 💜
Awww poor Jin and Jimin 😪💜 but you know what after watching this i love them even more 💜💜
This is so random but theres this kdrama called penthouse and min seol ah's other name was Anna Lee😳😂
"I see seokjin, I click, I subscribed I love you! 💜"
"OMG,I like your English, actually I'm learning Korean now because of bts so I can stream more on their music and not just Dynamite. Yeah,yeah"
This diet not so bad at all...i would just add some vegetables on the side with both meals an only eat 2 meals an coffee for breakfast lol 😆 thank's so much !
My moms toxic trait is making me a plate of something yummy when she knows I’m dieting I hate her lol. Anyways it’s crazy how Jin was doing this for a year I would fucking cry
"I know this isnt funny but why do I laugh so hard at her while I watching this? Saying shes so hungry 😂😂""  and Im not gonna eat chicken"" lmao 😂😂"
I followed jimin's diet but it didn't worked well for me and it more caused me mental problem and health problems so I accepted my body and I'm happy with myself  I'm a teen so I don't need to stress out so much abt my body
"10:50 this piece is definitely by Bach but I can't tell wich one, so frustrating 🤣💕"
Thanks so much for being so sensitive with how you filmed this. You're lovely to listen to...I thought I would quite after 2mins...
Noona can you please make a vlog........about Korea.... And the famous places
Daebak ... You are just amazing.....
Hey! One of my fav songs being played here 💕💕
"I have “fat” skin on my face too and it pinches just like yours😩😩😂💜 I wish Jimin wouldn’t worry so much about his looks...even for the BE album photos he was too thin.  I’ll never understand what it’s like to have my job depend on my looks (my patients don’t care as long as I keep them alive, thank god😂), but still. It makes me so sad for them sometimes, cause they’re perfect even with the extra weight.  It’s amazing what will happen if you just cut out extra salt from your diet. Doing it for 3 days, at least you don’t have to worry about muscle/fat loss cause it’ll mostly be water. And yes, the bathroom scale is awful, but it’s good for a rough idea of progress.  When I started to lose weight (over 100lbs, thank you very much😆), I actually did measurements and that helped SO much more than the number on the scale!  Sometimes that number stalls or goes up (especially if you’re the type to exercise-which I’m not😐), but that doesn’t mean you’re not making progress. 💜  Also, most people don’t cook chicken right so it ends up being dry and unappealing. It may be lacking in some flavor, but if you make it moist, it’s more bearable 😂 You’re beautiful too!!"
Im younger than you but I'm 57kg😑😐☹️ you're perfectttttt💜
im asian & i have a chubby face too even though i have a normal bmi of 20 and it sucks so much 😭 i’ve been trying to lose weight and i’ve lost only 3.5 pounds the past month lol
i love it. Jin i love you. unnie !! Can you tell us your skin-care routine and what type of products you use ?? plz!!!
"How do they manage that, they are always so positive every day, although besides the diet they still have to do so much like learning dances and lyrics by heart, producing songs, shooting videos for V.live for Yotube videos, music videos, etc.  Day exhausted that's just inhuman 🥺😢😱"
YAH! WE HAVE THE SAME PAIR OF CHOPSTICKS😂😂
"You showed Jimin's photo about his weight and with 174cm and 58.6kg is still on normal weight for his height. I am not trying to say he can loose more weight, I am just saying he isn't underweight :)"
"Moonlight sonata lol Edit, agree, I need nutrition for my brain so diet like this is no no.. 😂😆"
Wow. Thanks for trying Jin's diet and gave feedback. That's such an extreme diet for sure. I tried JK'S warm up work out and it was a killer.   Btw you're so pretty. You remind me of PARK MinYoung. 😍  PS. Yay!! I am a BTS army fan too! Did you go to their Wembley concert?!?!
Kudos to you for giving sound advice about not focusing on the numbers of the bathroom scale. Thumbs up! Please more yummy food videos in Korea
"omg i've never related more - i also dont really have issues with my body but all the fat just goes straight to my face. I'm the same height as you and i'm also close to 56 right now, while usually i'd be 54. I'll start losing weight tommorow, this really motivated me!!"
Love your british accent😭💕
Did someone explain to me Jimin ate 1 meal every 10 days or one meal a day for 10 days?  because spending 9 days without eating would have died.
2:43 that's what literally I do 😂
Btw your videos are so lively love your screen confidence ❤️
I am pretty sure your Dad got pastries because of the tattoos and the spicy noodle challenge videos.  I would do that if I were him.
That was crazy! I can't believe you managed to survive that! Thanks for all the disclaimers and I hope you're feeling better after your tummy went crazy on you at the end of it.
Omg welcome back queen  I missed ya
I wish I could do this diet.😭😭 But my mom wouldn't lemme . I am not a fan. But  unnie you are really pretty. You look like a k-pop idol.
I want to lose weight too but i know i cant do it heheh😅  I am not fat but also not too fit... And Jin hyung is just soooo beautiful...😍💜
OMG.unnie. U are soo pretty & beautiful... U Don't have any diet 😅... Korean girls are always perfect 🙂..but I'm also BTS Stan and my bias Jin 😁❤️
You need so much dedication to that diet! But you are already gorgeous dear! Thank you for this vlog! :)
Just found your channel! You are soooOooO pretty! And omg- I can’t believe he went through that- it’s so unhealthy.
"Thank you for sharing this, dear. I accidentally found your video. I'm ARMY too, and I am doing a diet too. My inspiration to do it is Namjoon. Yes, you're right. Not all diet types are suitable for us, especially from Kpop Star. I've ever tried a cup of Iced Americano, but my stomach couldn't accept it. Then, I got sick in the next day 😂"
OMGOSH THE PIECE AT 10:52 is prelude op28 no4 by chopin! (also called suffocation)  i can play it on the piano and i LOVE THAT SONG  edit: you don’t know how happy i was when i heard it lols
"I think you also have to know that what Jimin was doing wasn't to literally star himself bc he thought he wasn't good enough, he thought he was ugly and that he wouldn't have any fans, he even said that it was stupid and nobody should do that. He didn't do it bc bighit told hi to, he thought that he needed to do it to be famous"
i cant          *she is soo pretty and beautiful 🥺🥺🥺*
넌 너무 예뻐 언니 ❤️
"oh myyy you're right ""tons of chicken"" 😆 can't believe you survived it!! + how can Jin do that?!!"
"More foodie bids please 😃 It would be great to see Korean snacks, sweets and any bakery goodies that is unique there and how they are either better, worse or similar to British snacks."
Wow your attitude was so visibly different. Very interesting to watch.

"Every time these guys are shown anywhere, they got weed on them. Damn they be smoking too much. Where did they get this shit from ?.  Anyways, y’all are giants and y’all keep living y’all best lives."

J hope bengek
jinkook’s fond smile for each other is devastating!
Anything is nicer with their names on =)
"So sad that the only thing relatable about this video is when Jin says ""the marker is dry"" *cries in poor*"
When you’re so rich that writing on your brand new phone is really no big deal
Jungkook is such a little brother he just couldn’t resist ruining jins case😂😂
I can't express but Yoongi emptying Jungkook's perfume is me👀✌🏻
"I mean, I know Jin is always beautiful but this hair looks stunning on him."
jimin's whining when jin is about to write on it is hilarious.
Popular opinion: Every ARMY is happy because Min Yoongi is back
I always love seeing Jin and Jungkook's never ending saga of teasing each other  Ps: Yoongi is me whenever I see a perfume 😹
Tom & Jerry Jungkook and Jin XD
Army = *taking care to all BTS merch* Jin = *wrote in merch* Army = *crying*
BTS when filming for BANGTANTV: *Uses their Android phone* BTS when they are alone: *Uses their iPhone*
"Suga not minding Jin and Jk and just causally spraying the perfume, whole mood!!😂😂"
Jungkook: Tengo un perfume  Yoongi: Tenemos   Es muy tierno el bolsito de Kookie 😩💜
3:27 Yoongi gastando el perfume de Jungkook descaradamente 😂😂💜 Soy igual con mis amigas XD
"At the end jin~ ""Jan"" Did he know that it means life😂"
Seokjin is so considerate with others. He wrote his name to make it easier for the staff who take care bts's belongings since they have lots of same stuffs 😭💕
Jin... JK and Suga being each others cousins or siblings 😂
"Lol seriously after this video went viral, all the stuff in the jungkook's bag got sold out and were out of the stock !  I am jungshook !"
No One: *Jin's millionaire problems: Writing on a brand new Samsung phone*
Me realizing jungkook and I use the same toothpaste: 👁👄👁
jinkook’s minds fascinate me every time
Jin is a handsome af cant get over him💜
"Yoongi emptying Jungkooks perfume, this lil meow meow 😭😭😭"
Love seeing their bond. I’m glad they have each other.
Jin is wrote he is name i am jin and this is my phone say to all😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  ooh WORLD WILD HANDSOME
اعطوني الموبايل يلي شخبط عليه جين الله يخليكم😭
3:25 This is me when I find my friends perfume 😂🤣
Suga represents me when i open my sister's bag and use her perfume 😅🤣
Jin and Jungkook ruining each others things is pure sibling behaviour .......lmfao
No puedo expresarme pero Yoongi vaciando el perfume de Jungkook soy yo👀✌🏻
kookie real brave writing on the case so boldly
jin y jungkok son como niños cuando estan juntos
KIM SOOK JIN.
International army who feels happy after seeing Yoongi?!  👇
What's funny is Suga casually opening Jk's bag & taking out his perfumes and smelling them✋🏼😭 and using them lmaoo
"Jinkook, a nonstop saga🤭"
"Jin ""It doesn't have any case""  Me (broke who litteraly have 1 which is also so old)  🙃"
Popular opinion: Every ARMY is happy because Min Yoongi is back
aww did jk sit on jin's lap at the end awwww
the way i screamed at 1:55 rich kings wbk
yoongi taking interest in jungkook’s cute cooky things 🥺
"Kkkk vindo do Jin podemos  esperar de tudo , ele deve ter escrito Jungkook você é bonito, mas eu sou o mais belo de todos nós, vocês sabem né a autoestima do nosso belo jin é surreal   Kkkkk amooo. Afinal perde-se o amigo, porém, jamais a piada  🤣🤣🤣😂😂😊😊😍😍😍🤗🤗🤗😜😜😜"
Jin litteraly act me😭😂😂😂😂😂
I love seeing Jungkook so relaxed and happy here.
JK is the definition of a MAN we wanted but it can never be ours...  He's very organized...
I'm Yoongi when there are free perfumery samples at the mall
"""Army And BTS Doesn't Have A Happy Ending, Because Our Story Will Never End.""                                            - Kim Seokjin~"
Soy Yoongi cuando hay muestras gratis de perfumería en el súper o centro comercial 🤠👊🏻
O Guinho usando e abusando do perfume do Kook kkkkkk
Suga semi we love it so please don't give up on T-armies
plsss jungkook writing on jin's case with 'kick it' in the background 😭😭
Jungkook: I have a new perfume   yoongi: we have
2:16 is a real nct 127 moment
day by day jin's looking hotter!! (can actually melts me) he looks like an actor <3
Me dio muchisima ternura la carterita de cooky de jungkook y como yoongi uso su colonia
Aww Jk has a toilet bag how cute 🥺 is that ♥️ Jungkook love everything in order and he's so clean 🥰
Nobody: Jin and jungkook: *sabotaging each other* Yoongi: lemme see that perfume
3:27 my friend's when they saw a perfume in my bag.
JinKook's never ending bickering😍
Jimin worries and doesn't get the fact that the cell phone doesn't loose its value but instead rises its value just for having Jin's sing on it.  Jimin se preocupa y no entiende que el celular no pierde su valor sino que incrementa su precio sólo por tener la firma de Jin en él.
JINKOOK RADIATES SIBLING ENERGY. FIGHT ME.
"JK:""Jan..."" Jin: ""JK....""  While suga: ""There is barely inside the bag"""
C'mon Jimin's lil whines at 0:19 and 0:24 were literally the cutest things ever 🥺🥺🥺 Also Kookie's adorable Kooky toiletry bags 🥺🥺
Jin and Jungkook are the definition of best brothers!!!
Jinkook is hope 😍 Bromance is happiness 💜
The revenge on Cooky’s pouch 🤣🤣🤣
Yoongi is that one friend who likes to check his friend's bag and use their stuff for no apparent reason.  I'm Yoongi :)
yoongs emptying kookie's perfume is all of us istg
"Jin going to write on ho new phone, my heart beat ➿〰️➿"
"Oh, It seemed to me to see a worldwide handsome"
"*Army pls vote bts on sma voting app now!! (10 votes a day for each category) focus on 'main' category first then 'Kwave' category then 'legend' category then other category!* *quick, other fandom already started voting!!* ‼"
"""What's written on Jin and Jungkook's stuff?"" 2,4M people: Interesting *Click"
jin blowing air like a babie i'm soooooooft
Why do jhope look so rich there🤣🤣🤣
كوك خرب اسم جين و سماه جان😂 قام جين ردها له و خرب شنطايته و خربش عليها بالقلم😂😭💓💓💓ياعمري توم و جيري احبهم مرررره
Jungkook queriendole partir la madre y luego agarrar a besos a Seokjin es mi religión gente
Yoongi: Smells perfume Yoongi: Proceeds to bathe himself in it  Edit: OMG 900 likes I'm speechless you guys. Thank you and thank you Suga!!
BRUHHHH THIS IS WHAT I MEAN JINKOOK ARE EVERYTHING!!! THEYRE SO CUTE!! AND THEN YOONGI SPRAYING THE PERFUME WAS EVERYTHING AWWW
Jungkook's Cooky toiletry bag is so cute!
Suga is me when sees my friend's perfume😆🤣

I can't hide my laughter when Jin write his name so BiG 🤣🤣
Verlos hacer estas cosas random me revitaliza xD

Sugaya baxanda dostum yadıma düşdü girib çantamdan duxuma zada əl atıb özünkü kimi istifadə edir ( düzü mən də eləyəm😂) Azerbaijani ARMY 🇦🇿
Jin: *about to write on a brand new phone * Jimin: don't do it  Jin: I'm not gonna do it girl I'm just thinking about it ...I'm not gonna do it  Two seconds later Jin: I did it !
i feel you jimin 0:19
Jin: ''The marker's dry！''😂😂   Thank you for wonderful videos💕

Slovenia...army 💜💜
Jinkook just love each other this much. This is so sweet 😍
The boys singing DBSK was something I didn't know I needed.
"yo en 2017 poniendo *""bitiez tuz patronez""* en cualquier lugar que veía:"
Popular opinion: Everyone agrees that Jungkook and jin teasing each other is the best part of this video
The world of BANGTAN
公園までに行く途中で都築さんが、ちょっとダンスの振り確認してるのを指差して、「おいダンプ！こいつ30分経ったのに練習してるけどいいのか？」とルールにガチな後藤さん

韓国にあこがれる人と、とりあえず高い服を着る人と、学生時代から服装変わらない人
都築くんは手足が紐の木製の人形みたい笑
都築さんのダンス味があって最高！！骨盤が人の可動域を超えてるのか？何度も見てしまうw
There are subtitles. You have to enable closed caption (CC).
Jhope: Continuously talking and  throwing random ideas instead of writing V: writing quietly (Totally opposite)😂😂
Looks like V ate a dozen almonds before shooting this. He is so cleverrr
"""But we can't play with Jungkook."" ""Huh? Why can't you play with me?"" ""Because you're too good."""
Nobody:  Not even broke people:  Jin: Let’s book a mountain Sir- that ain’t light😭🗿
"No matter how solemn and quiet Taehyung this days, Jimin simple antics can make him roll in laughter."
Taehyung writes down his idea for jungkook because he realized that jungkook didn't write anything in his sketch book. My hearteu✋
Nobody talking about the way RM tease V and asked him to tell about his first love and v rxn was priceless 🤣
Jimin is literally an angel to Tae. he encourage and supports and include Tae in everything. he also makes everyone laugh. JIMIN you nice keep going.
"Jimin is so supportive of Taehyung, he claps, agrees with his idea and votes for his suggestion! What a soulmate!"
"I don't know why I'm so happy seeing Taehyung laughing and smiling because of Jimin,  they're literally soulmate goals and Tae looks so whipped !"
"I really like V's ideas. Like imagine them playing different instruments or having a band where there are drummers, pianist, guitarist and etc. BRILLIANT IDEAS V!"
"My jiminssi is an angel to taehyung, the way he cares for V, I don’t know if u see it but I do ✨🥺💘"
Why is nobuddy talking about tae's reaction when Rm asked him about his first love ✌
IDK if Jin is presenting ideas or he is MC-ing the show 😂
Can you imagine Taehyung in class. I wouldn't be able to concentrate. I would be staring at him the whole time. He's so flipping adorable and extremely intelligent..
Jimin is the best best best best friend for tae ... He always support him... Tae gonna start presenting everyone noisy he said silence on his higher voice .... Give a great applause to his every Idea ..... ( My english is little poor guys ✌️) But .... Jimin is the best person i have ever seen 💝  Edit :Thanks for 100 like guys  💜
"No one: literally no one: Jhope: *""pre--si--den--tation""* 5:47  I love them <3"
"Jimin wanting everyone to be together, make friendship accessories, and play tag and hide and seek together.    *IM SOFT DONT TOUCH ME 🥺💞.*"
Jinkook is like classmates who love to chitchat and cheat in class
No one: Literally no one: Jhope: (unbothered) eating quietly 😂😂 33:09
Suga: “The best one among us will play in singles” Rm immediately: “JUNGKOOK”🤣🤣 36:18
Taehyung being quiet when they talked about roller skates lmao
"Just Jimin, always supporting V's idea and opinions. The soulmate"
jungkook bringing back the rrrrap monster is everything
'jungkook doing aegyo' Jin:'He cried when we teased him in the past'  'oww that so cute 🥺'
Our taetae is shy when hes member say that show your acting skills
26:49 V 😍😍😍😍
"V doesn't give himself enough credit when he has ideas. He doesn't think his opinions matter. My dear bias, everything you have to say is well-deserving of praise. Do not doubt yourself and what you have to offer. I love my bias wrecker Jimin. He's always there to support his bestie. Omg, I just adore their friendship. 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
I love how Namjoon didn't complain when Jin said he wanted to go before him.He also gave Tae another chance even though he had already presented his ideas before. There is this selflessness to Namjoon that I have never seen in anybody before.He is always supporting others and putting others before him.He does it so quitely you might not notice it.But the more you watch him closely the more you realize how caring and considerate he is.
"I like Jimin idea making friendship accecories, also the one makin run bts theme song from rm and makin mv for bts song that doesnt have mv"
"Jungkook being teased by the members.. Jin: ""He cried when we teased him in the past""  Aigoo Jeeekkkeeyy 😂😂"
I love how jimin always support v and telling the others to stay focus when v present
I think v's idea to make song and learn and play music instrumental is good idea..people will know that bts is very talented not only singing and dancing..i home they will consider it
Tae and Jimin share such a adorable bond
"it makes me so sad that v is so quiet here, for whatever the reason."
Jhope and Jin interaction always become funny moment in Run BTS
"What jhope done here: Eating asmr Hair dresser challenge I'm afraid of water, I'm afraid of speed, it's dangerous to play Suggesting WWE as long term sports challenge  I got bronze medal in tennis and cried when I was small kid. Named presentation as presidentation I can't serve well in 🎾 tennis And he is adorable and very very cute in this episode ❤️❤️"
I'm proud of jin being and JINtelligent and a jinious 😂😂👍🏻
V and Jhope are totally opposite  V: Not at all opening his mouth about his ideas  Jhope: Just saying all ideas🤣
Plzzzz it's not only jimin and RM everyone is trying to listen V and cheering him up❤️❤️❤️ everyone is caring about him
"If RM ask to SUGA about his first love     SUGA: ""listen boy, my first love story"""
Jin...the most confident member's ear becomes red when so many ppl look at him😂😂😂😂😂😂
34:32 probably from Seoul to Bhusan and 10km in 3min means 200Km in 60mins so approx 400km in 120 mins which is 2hrs and distance is less than 400km . Damn Namjoon calculated it in fraction of second 😮 👏 I appreciate it
I liked v's idea of going in public without people recognising but since BTS is popular it may be difficult..but I liked every v's idea and RMS idea of OST for run BTS ..
I love how RM and Jimin supports and encourages V. A very good leader and a true friend.
"It's sad that they didn't choose Taehyungs second idea, would have been so fun"
"Joonie is soooo supportive and easy to get along with.. Its so clear that ge supported tae but without making it obvious.. Like how can someone be so selfless ,pure and caring!!!!  I love namjoon the most in the world 😭"
"When BTS Said jin is the one who lighten up the mood, they ain’t lying"
No one; literally no one; RM to V;Tell us about your first love!! LMAO..
"33:07 *My gosh!...Hobi's look here is killing me. His eyes, the way his hair level on his eyes, his nose/his face!! always making me so--- urgh!* *It's so hard to explain! There are always times that Hobi's simple look is melting me*"
Imagine Jin being a  lecturer in a university. Wow!
"Tae- when the weather is good and the world gets better  Jin- repeat it , I thought this line is from 'Guardian' Me- Goblin fan"
Jimin is actually a best frnd he is really encouraging tae & make him participate too.We all need a frnd like him.
6:06 jhope wasn't kidding when he offered to make suga's heart race faster we all saw him doing that on GDA's awards 😂😂😂
"if j-hope says it's 'presidentation', it is presidentation.  we don't know any presentation"
Taetae's so creative.  Sugar offering taetae to teach him basketball was the sweetest thing ever 🐻.  Taetae's so adorable and lovely that's why he really adore and praised by all of his brothers and us 😍
No one:  Jimin: “I’M SPEAKING!” *stomp stomp*
And RM asked V to tell him about his first love?💀💀💀💀
Tae: 'Role of a Mafia'😮 Meanwhile tae's ff authors:🤐😌😱 😂😂😂😂
On one side:Taekook with their mother and father On other side:Taekook shippers Me:*ohhh intense meeting*
"I don't know why but I like it when jimin say ""don't laugh taehyung😂"" to tae.. it feels like when I'm with my friend 😂😂"
The sincere concern goes to jimin. He has a deeep understanding to TAE. Jimin is a great friend.
"Jimin is cracking me up,i feel like his ‘be solemn’ is about to get iconic Edit: 15:23 awww....taehyung and kookie is so sweet"
No one:  Yoongi to Jimin: You are a loose screw today😂😅 Don't you have enough sleep?😂😎
I love how jimin is getting *trusfrated*coz the others keep butting in...😂😂
*Production team must be out of ideas that's why they seek for BTS' help for the next run episodes theme. LMAO 124 episodes and counting* 😂😂
"6:01 well, damn, j-hope, that was smooth"
Did hobi just asked suga : do you want me to make ur heart race?💀💀💀💀💀💀
Jin to jk   He cried when we teased him in the   past
Jin's Goblet of Fire maze idea was my favorite- my two worlds colliding. My ultimate bias is a big Potterhead like me and I couldn't be happier.
Taehyung really has an intelligent mind. He's more intelligent than I have thought of. He looks like a beautiful doll in this episode.
26:19 Jin laugh is so contagious😂
"Hobi :- Next,I want to do BTS healing special. The name has a special meaning behind it. Tae :- Do we film it at our parents' house?  Oh boy,he must be missing his family a lot.😔🥺I hope he gets to meet them and spend some quality  Time with them. Not only him but also the rest of the members as well.🥺💜"
Didn't anyone notice even members know jimin's love for his dad 🥺
We all know that Suga is a savage. But some of us don't know the fact that suga is sweet like sugar.
*My heart melts when yoongi adds psychological counselling or mental analysis as an idea. He really cares not only for their physical but for their mental health*  💜
Taehyung i like your idea as always you have bright idae im sure army will be happy seeing the 7 amazing members playing different instruments which is new idea.Good luck . Actually all the members have good ideas.Love you all 7 amazing men.
"members: meeting chaoticly hobi: eating jin: ""STOP EATING"""
I really hope they go with Jimin's idea one day and have them make accessories we can buy. also I'd love to see them styling hair! I feel like J-Hope would be really good with a curling iron.
SUGA SMILE IS HEALING ME....LOVE YAH MIN SUGA SHIIIII
Why isn't anyone talking about tae offering his idea to jk when jk didn't have any ideas to write💜💜💜😭😭😭so sweet
RM: tell us about your first love.  V: *shook*
"I like jhope's idea of them as stylists, that would be epic!! Specially if jin cut the hair like when he cut his own hair in the live xD jsjsjs 😂😂😂😂"
J-hope win bronze medal and started cry  when he was kid 😂😂😂
"From the latest few episodes, you can notice that V wasn't in his best state. And I love how the other members are lowkey trying to lift him up : Jimin, RM, JK inciting him to speak and SUGA telling him that he still has their matching necklaces. I love their bond!❤"
Tae Tae: speaks Jimin: oh my god. So good. You nice keep going. Me: you should be a friend like jimin
"Still can't get over the fact that taehyung suggested "" A MAFIA GAME lmao 😹 lmao he is giving hints I read that too army"
"I liked the way V quietly focused on writing the amazing ideas... And also his thoughts on going in public without being recognised! He is so calm, serious and intelligent, ofc handsome (no doubt🥰)"
I love how JIMIN hypes Taehyung❤️❤️
When V said about mafia game I was like wait a damnn did he see all the FFs made by armyss???😂😂
"Jhope :What if we meet wild animals?  Jin :If you meet wild animals, catch them  😂😂😂😂"
Jin is one of those members who makes every Run bts episode a masterpiece.  (Oh wait he is himself a master piece made by God ).
15:21 The way Kookie spoke when Tae told him to take his idea is the cutest
"I really like tae's idea, going out and trying not to get reconized"
"Kim Taehyung & his brilliant ideas 👏 , he's really intelligent and thoughtful 🤗"
Jimin is angel to Taehyung. Seriously he support him every time. How lucky they are.
Suga: I rarely... Jhope: Do you want me to make your heart race fast?  💜😍😄😂 SOPE NATION LET US RISE!!!
V is really very cleaver and has a unique vision of  seeing everything
Namjoon exists  le JK ''rrrrrrrrrrrrap monstaaaaaaa''
Hello my best friend!  What would you like to see the next video about? You can write something nice and wait for the next video   👉 Watch More: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynGq84h9CGY&list=PLjsgRqV955DyObwD2iD2OBZRqm5ZDWe4r
Everytime after jimin make a mistake... His expression is hella cute...
Everyone does mistakes but BTS cover them professionally  * chef kiss *
Who loves our 7 wonders?? 👇💜💜💜
The fact that even if there mistakes are really cute they manage it so professionally is everything...💜
Remember when V forgot the lyrics during The Truth Untold and Jungkook and Jin can't stop laughing? That's the funniest mistake 🤣
But they look even more cute when they realize their mistake 😝😝
Their cute mistakes make army's happy they are so cute like kids they grow up but their cuteness never ends
JIMIN : Makes mistakes ME : Burst into laughter😂😂  BTS EVERY MOMENTS IS SO CUTE💜😘
I  really love their cute mistakes. We purple U BTS 💜💜🇮🇳
Junngkooks smile is the cutest thing ever 💜
J-Hope has the sixth sense when someone messes up ahhaha our dance king 💜
When they make mistake during performance in their concerts. I don't understand that why they cry soo much after the performance in back stage. It hurts when they cry. It's ok if you make a mistake. You guys are humans too 🤷🏻‍♀️💜
Jimin running to find his spot in bwl with that  cute outfit🤧❤
It's a mistake we enjoyed it rather than complaining 🤭🤭💜💜💜💜
Jimin is the one who makes cutee mistakes 😍 Little mochi  And there hobi makes a scary look when a member of BTS makes mistake
Fun fact: *Hobi's eyes catch those mistake immediately*
8:03 RM’s cutest dimples
First time💜👇🏼 1 RM 😂😂 2 JIMIN 😂😂3 SUGA 😂😂4 JK 😂😂 5 Jhope 😂😂 6 V 😂😂 7 Jin 😂😂 they are soo quet lol💜
Everyone will see jhope when they make a mistake

10:03 was I the only one who hit their forehead 🤦 😂❣️ their  mistakes are soo cute 😣
The way Jimin messes with own legs are so perfect (θ‿θ)
"When the members made a mistake on choreography, everyone else is laughing except for J-Hope 😂😂😂"
Everyone I watched BTS's ad before starting this video ..and i didn't skipped it 😂 Lol I enjoyed it  Normal people :  skips ad ARMY : searches and watch the ads
3:34 it looks like everybody was looking at jhope for his reaction !
3:28 that sound remind me of my my mom's typical Indian serials😅🤣🤣
Ahh Jimin looks sooo damn cute when he makes some mistake!  I can't resist 😩😍💜💜
They're really cute when they're making mistakes😂💜Bts said that where not comedians were idol but for me they're are best comedians 💜
It's all Fun and cute until J HOPE steps in 😂😂
I still remember how taehyung told that its not in my vocabullary when he was asked what would they do if they made mistake in their performance🤣🤣
9:46  You all overwhelmed by jungkook's open shirt  While me over here re-watching this scene to hear the sound of demons chanting their names.(Ik its army ily army)
Jimin is so shyy🤣😍😍
JIMINIE IS SO SO CUTEEEE OUT BABY MOCHI 💜
Just a moment ago I was so sad that I couldn't smile even after seeing those cute mistakes but Jimin really made me smile and you edited it so nicely. Thank you both of you 💜.
These boys making our Army's smiles 🙂
10:06 Yoongi just be standing there laughing without even spotting Jin's fall I can't XD Good thing he's okay HAHAHHAHAAH
Namjoon is sooo manly... I am head over heels for him...
"Poor People like me who Can’t skip the ads, When It comes about BTS!!!!!💜💜💜"
I am happy about the fact that Jin doesn't make any mistake during dancing 🕺🕺    Proud Army 💜💜💜
They are idol but the important is they are also human 🤣🤣🤣  Ohhh they are so cute when they 're finally realize 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5:16...😂😂😂😂...Some one said right...there mistake is also adorable
Jk always laughing at his hyungs' mistakes is always hilarious. He'll never let you live it down.
The way jhope looks when other members does a mistake. OMG My heart is...……..
Moral: Jimin the king of mistakes😂👑🤴
Oh my god Namjoon zipping his pant in middle of the performance 🤭
I’m so glad that they can laugh about their mistakes now 😀
TURKISH ARMY 💜
They smartly managed every single mistakes but mistakes were sooooo cute..
"Taehyung once said ""i will never make mistake in the dance choreography"" I am perfect "" . Here you go , Taehyung making cute mistakes 🤧🤧😉😉😉"
"Me looking at 7 beautiful men singing/dancing  don't even notice any mistakes, til you point it out. I don't mind"
I cried when rm was shaking on the stage lol-
Look how they manage their cute mistakes that is professionalism💜💜💜💜
6:01 jimin kills me everytime 😂😂 literally in his own world
4:34 laughed so hard at Namjoon. Gurl the energy lmaoooo 5:35 lmaoooooo yoongi too
I feel like they should have fun in their performances and interviews and not having to worry about mistakes
It’s so cute when they make mistakes and they laugh about it 😂💜
These mistakes were very funny but in black swan part when jhope face was hurt I was like 😩 9:02
"Does it sound like ""HI GUYS"" 3:56??"
I am just dying when i see Jungkook's abs😭😭💜💜💜
suga still swag in losing that microphone
Iam surprised no one talking about jhope getting hit on his head he was hurt and tell he feel he will faint. guys it's not a cute mistake
Jimin só cai com estilo. 😂😂
They all r so cute and handsome ❤️ they make so cute mistakes  When they got their mistake they look more cute 😅  OUR 7 WONDERFUL KINGS 💜💜 Love you BTS ❤️
Jimin looks so cute even when he makes mistakes❤😘
I think mistakes make them laugh but beware of J-Hope 😜

Makes a mistake on stage Other members: 😂😂😂 Hobi: *gives the mom at church when she catches you talking stare*😂😂😂😂😂😂 Gotta love them 💜💜
Not jk pretended to wipe his tears-😭😭😭😂
7:21 please what is Namjoon doing 😭😭😂
Members: I hope j-hope does notice if I make a mistake   During performance: *steps on Hobi and kicks him in the face 😳😅  Hobi: 👀😐
"*""It's okay humans do mistakes, if a human don't do any mistakes it means that human have never tried to do something new.""*"
Haters say that Jin continues glaring at the members during performance(he just makes sure that he is dancing rightly).😑 But never say that he doesn't make much mistakes and dances perfectly on stage. 🤐🙁 Their mistakes are hella cute.😂 They prove that how professional they are by covering the mistakes nicely. 😎😋
Even though they make mistakes...... Army loves them very very much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jimin is so cute and funny i just can't stop laughing here like a idiot in front of my screen
So cute. Mostly RM being the cutest baby boy :)
This compilation just made my day 😂😂😂

Jungkook's hobby is stepping on hyungs' shoes😂
"3:18 I’m dead laughing for Jimin, someone protects him please 😂😂"
I get scared every time they give props to Namjoon😂...and Jhopes reactions to their mistakes is everything lols

Jimin's Jacket and missing position problems are so cute HAHA

Every one makes mistakes and I literally don’t care if they do a mistake mostly junkook cries because he didn’t do well on stage I mean......its okay fans care about them a lot and they think about it a lot when they do a mistake. I feel bad when they cry
Aaahh Namjoon'a çok güldüm 😂😂😂
"*#2:Jimin's kick was so powerful* he was unbalanced on the next  move + his giggle was soo cute!💜 Love all their goofs + mistakes, makes them even cuter, lol!!💜💜"
The fact that suddenly in 3:28  typical indian serial music starts ....omg this is so funny

1:43  Hobi looks like a Kindergarten Baby boy trying to fix his new hat 🥺❤️...... My heartu is 🤧
"I wish real life Jimin was my friend. Not BTS Jimin. Off stage Jimin is funny, quirky, goofy, intelligent, loving, caring.  He's a very talented artist but even more a fantastic individual.  I am not even part of the Army but still cannot dislike these guys 😊"
2:14 Taehyung laugh so hard that he fell out of the chair just because of jimin 💜😂😂

"Jimin is just it! He is so star-like, so entertaining, so so everything.  LOVE HIM!!!!!"
I wish they would have a channel...like a normal YouTube channel where they do pranks on each other like others do. You know?
When u fall for those funny baby things baby Mochi do then it's called a Jimin effect
Hhhhhh....really smile junkook very cute ohhh jimine very  funny
"Jimin goes on and on about his height, but has no idea just how unimportant that is to all of the tall women in the world who love him just the way he is."
"His smile is my everything ❤️ but thing guy is a full time comedian l his a full package honestly :- sexy ,cute,lovely, Funny, goofy, kind😂💜💜"
"0:54 the way JK laughs at JM's face he's pulling! I love Jimin sooo much, he's so talented, charming and funny! No one quite like him! Also I live for the way JH laughs at JM <3"
If he keeps on being like this I swear I will kidnap this mochi and keep him with me forever...😂😂

"Awwwww, so cute💜💜💜💜💜💜😚"
Jimin is so cute ❤️
"3:23 LOL   The funny thing about this part is that it happens directly after J-Hope asks Jimin if he can fart in Korean. Then it low-key sounds like Jimin responds by saying “I did it now” in English. Then J-Hope scoots away from Jimin, and it kind of looks like Jimin flared his nostrils a bit, lol. I think the English subtitles had Jimin saying something different though,  haha. Jimin was being a brat that entire scene."
WORLD WAR THREE 🌍🌍 Hobi - Laughing 😂😂 Suga - Why are you laughing ?? Hobi - It's world war three 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  And then Suga be like - SO WHAT 😒😒😒😒

1:07 and here is our meme ....screenshot 😆😆
Plzzz let them meet BTS ... this is a huge request from armies ... plz let these cute baby  armies meet BTS ... PLZ
"Not just the kids, even their dad is whipped for BTS 💜💜 I really hope BTS can meet them soon 💜💜"
These baby armys are so cute.  Hope they get to meet BTS.
*Just make a run bts episode with the task being babysitting- AND BrING LOADS OF BABIES*
"I hate KBS for lying to the Hammingtons,,, using bts for clout,, and treating txt as replacements and not their own groups"
"Oh God I can imagine how disappointed the kids were when they didn't get to meet BTS. TXT are cute and all, but their expectation when going there was to meet BTS. Poor babies."
"""I'm RM"" ""I'm V"" 😂😂😂OMG they are so cute"
"I'm pretty sure if they meet bts, Taehyung will go crazy over William  and Ben.  Tysm for the likes"
"RM wants to be a dad, imagine RM talking in English language with them 🤭"
"This cute boy pointing while saying ""Jungkook!!"" the cutest way possible.."
I am now hoping for BTS to visit William and Bentley. The li'l boys seem genuinely fond of them. I am quite disheartended they didn't meet but please make it happen in the future.
"KBS you should Introduce TXT proper way , They're not just Junior of BTS   And the way you use BTS for clout, really don't like this"
"will genuinely loves RM, like not in passing, he honestly looks up to him you can tell. it’s so precious!"
"""We'll meet them if we're lucky.""  Gosh.. that breaks my heart that they didn't meet bts but I'm glad they met txt. Really, txt should shine more!"
"everytime ben said ""jungkook"" so cutee"
KBS stop getting their hopes up. BTS is so busy you're basically pressuring them to do this by shaming them with how many videos youve put with their name on there. have some consideration :/
Children were so cute before you deceived them... it was so sad to watch them being upset...
"As a grown ass adult who loves RM,I can imagine how down that cute little kid might be feeling.He genuinely looks up to him,and for god sakes he's just a kid.  Please pleaaaase let him meet RM,let them meet BTS😭😭"
Even though I have not met them myself but please someone let William meet RM. Please Please please please.............
At this point William and Bentley are presenting us ARMY especially when William asked if he and RM are friends just cause of a same hockey stick. Tell me if that is not what Army thinks? Lmao same mind😁
"im a quite dissapointed with kbs. we all know bts is extra busy on that days so dont give so much hope to the willbengers. its okay for an adult to not getting to see them, but when u ruin a kid's dream, it is just another heartbreaking moment for me. im getting emotional. its ok for me to be a fan without ever meeting them once, but i hope bts will meet them soon :( im sad"
"For those who haven't watch or know the issue, kbs has recieved some backlashes in SNS for (un)intended {i don't know whats the real deal, olrite guys} setup where the kids is hopefull to meet bts, while at that moment TXT is the one who showed up. Some call out for not being considerate to the kids or disrespect to TXT (to be considered as subtitute, cause they have their own name).  I just hope the matter can be cleared up soon, and the boys do get to meet bts eventually, and txt still be there as their own identity, cause they love the boys so much, well who isn't ;D ^^"
the dynamite costumes are so precious
"William be whipped for rm tho, who doesnt"
"Army : we love RM JK,William : hold my milk"
The kid who wanted to sit in RM's seat. Just ADORABLE AWW
William's each & every expressions are screaming that how much he loves RM💜😭
"Now, I always see William's face everytime I see Namjoon's face lol 😂  Hope they'll meet BTS soon"
William is really whipped for RM 💜💜💜
"Awww... I am spellbound. How can such litttttle kids be such ardent fans of someone / something. That too they have such love for BTS 😍🥰😍😍😍😍... Little Army.. which solidifies the fact that BTS is not just some dressed up - make up clad group of young boys singing something.... THEY ARE TALENTED, SOUL SINGERS WHO HAPPEN TO BE BEAUTIFUL INSIDE OUT.. who better to recognise truthful love than innocent heart 💕 of kids... They r sincerely most difficult of minds to impress.. n how he kept singling out JK n recognised ice hockey stick...  N m flabbergasted at the patience these lil bulbs showed in waiting for BTS inside bts' building.. they weren't crazily running around. Shows a real good upbringing by parents too. 👍 Love these kids... Ofcourse ❤️ BTS.🔥"
"They are so cute! 😂 ""If you don't let us in ,we will force our way in"" 😂💜💜💜"
We know Ben's bias is V and William's bias is RM :)
it's funny how Ben's bias is Taetae but his eyes are only on Jungkook. hahaha i feel you Ben.
As an armmyy I really really wish these cute little babie army meet BTS members very soon and mostly iwish William met RM he is so desperate and very much curious to meet RM and want to make him as his friend to 😂😆
Aww I love how William idolizes RM so much. The kid adores him so much 💜
SO CUTE RM WILL BE HAPPY TO SEE THIS WILLUAM HAS A GOOD EYE AND TASTE RM IS THE BEST ONE
Namjoon will love William bsjskskksksksns omgggg
"The way bentley look while saying jungkook,all his lip,eyes,pronounce and everything :) kinda look like he's the  child of jk version 1:25 watch carefully"
These cute babies meeting wilth legandary megastar BTS....
NOOO WAY THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR🥺 if only they could babysit them but covid 😭
I have never seen such a cute enthusiastic fan for RM ....this is soo cute .... please let them meet
"I pray they will meet BTS, it would be the cutest thing ever."
Namjoon <3 William is so cute
"Bently really like Jungkook 😂 he went ""igo jeongguk"" ""yeogido jeongguk inne"" ""arhh igo jeongguk""🥺🥺 he is so cute!When I sae their pictures,I also become like that🐰💜only army can relateXD"
"If they get a chance to meet BTS, please give a chance to Yeonwoo as well. He has been an army since long..💜"
Please let them meet bts in next episode
"Gosh RM you have one cute mini version of you who is a, huge fan. And I am fan of that cute little RM and V too."
I really want armys to personally request bighit and bts to meet these angels. Maybe on twitter or something. This would seriously make all of us happy. I really want to see the boys reactions to meeting these little angel armys.
V hyung and yoongi are actually big fans of willben.
Stop giving these boys false hope that if they act cute and just show up places BTS are they'll get to meet them. It's really bothersome.
i remember how tae told army to wath ben and welliam hes so sweet
Rm Omo😭 that's so sweet
Me imagining how BTS will react seeing them Me: oh my heartuu melted
THE WAY BEN CALLED 'JUNGKOOK' IS JUST SO CUTE
This is soo funny and touched at the same time. They represents all the army's that wants to meet BTS. Hope they can neet BTS and hope i can also go to their concert in the future. Love BTS and WillBen
"woah.... william is so adorable, being able to shed tears because he cant perfect his heart shape for bts and even loving noodles because RM loves to eat noodles...amazing how he shows his love for RM and BTS... and by the way.. ben too... he likes V and suddenly jumping when he see jung kook photos everywhere... and last but definitely not the least our dearest appa, mr. hammington.... being totally swept by jimin's charm... woah..... daebak!!!!!! they're so fun to watch"
Please Sam is so whipped for Jimin actually 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
"Ohh God, I seriously want BTS to see all these William and Bentley video crushing on them!!🥺🥺 Like 제발요!!!!😭😭💜💜"
I can imagine uncle Jin wiggling his tongue at William and Ben if they met BTS.
Their bias Sam :- jimin William :- RM Bentley :- V
The only they can meet BTS is if they guest in RUN BTS. As an army we know BTS last appearance on variety show was in 2017 so its really hard to invite them. It would be so awesome if they will show up in run bts I wanna see some RM and William interaction.
"Just imagine the smiles on the face of our bangtan if they watched these kids, they're sooo cute... 🥰 I really hope that they get to meet BTS..."
Imagine Rm watching this... RM:OMG...i want to see them..
"Best part was when he started singing dynamite 😂 so cute kids, teens,adults everybody loves BTS 💜."
Someone tell BTS manager to schedule them a visit or at least by video call.
"*Not only BTS have a positive impact on adults, but they are also a genuine role model in the eyes of the children who love them.*"
Ah Wiliam and Ben are so adorable ❤️
Dear KBS Please let our lovely Will-Ben meet BTS💜
3:28 this is the taste of love...  That's right 😂 and whatever William is talking.. Like the assumptions he is making ( does that mean he is my friend etc)  true army feelings 😂
I feel so sorry for the cute kids they were so excited and happy to see bts but they could'nt get a chance please let them meet BTS 💜
2nd part pls 🙏🏻 to meet the bts
I'm pretty sure Namjoon saw this and his heart melted with sweetness 🐨💜
"5:27 damn, I am proud of BTS and of my self, I stan the best group"
"as RM stan I feel insecure with his fanboys, Kookie and William 😭✊"
"Omggggg!!!!  Atleast they can, sit and eat in the place where bts had their food😭❤"
Ok just imagine V and Rm hanging out with them 😭 I'll just cry
William has now surpassed Jungkook's admiration level for RM and I'm glad to know that💜 He is a cutie ssksjdj. Borahae HTS💜
"I'm Ben, everytime I see jungkook i will point it out lmao"
"Kinda teared up when the kid asked ""If I eat this, will I be like RM?"" and ""does that mean I am friends with RM"" uwu 🥺🥺 felt so bad for these kids for not meeting BTS 🥺"
At first only the kid was telling jungkook's name 🤣🤣🤣😂so cute
These kids killed me with their cuteness!!!
1:25 my man got bias wrecked by jungkook lol
V-tley keeps pointing at Jungkook and bts is such a mood
Oooh.... this is the sweetest thing ever 💜💜💜
BTS really busy.. But we really hope BTS  can spend little time for this cute family..I confident BTS will meet them soon coz BTS never disappoint us.. And we know KBS is really good company who always respect and help promote idol artist
Let them meet to JuNcOK and RM for god's sake!!
I also want to meet Bts😢💜 That kid was really luck who already met to Txt and now planning to Bts so luck 💜💜💜💜💜💜 Broken Army's let's cry together do u agree .
I want them to meet them so bad. Id be so happy for them
"I just feel so happy knowing william admires joon so much lmao,he's so cute."
I can't wait to see Ben and William meeting BTS 😍
I really wish they could met BTS...
I am literally crying 😭💔 they are very cute and they love BTS 💜.....this is example for some BTS haters
da tanta ternura como el niño admira a RM
just let them meet their hyung!!! they must be so happy!!! they're so cuteeee
I wish BTS will visit and eat again in this place if they have time. Borahae 💜
Tae is gonna flip if we gets to meet those cuties!

"I never knew I needed sweaty long haired Jungkook rapping in my life, but I do."
No cap Jungkook is The 4th Member of the Rap Line. 😌
Who is happy that yoongi is back? I am dead 😢👀❤️     👇👇
Nothing.... But RM's shirt is killing me like anything😍😍😍😍😍
3:48 So is no one gonna talk about this JUNG HOSOEK.....He is literally killing armys out there🔥🔥💜
I just cant imagen how they were feeling to perform this song after all these years damn
Let's wear white and not tell JK and Tae 😂
RM: “To all the ARMY’s out there”  Me: *blushes 😊
I missed my Rapper JK💜
0:51 jungkooks mom  wants him  to go to the library for 7 years and he didn't go yet BAD BOY !!
damn *BANGTAN* are so *HOT*
Taekook was  invisible lol ..
"RM really likes this one, lol. I would say this song is perfect for him. I like how the BTS Members seemed to get more masculine in build as they got older."
They all wearing simple jeans and shirt ...but they look like heaven ..which is killing me🔥🙂🔥
AHHH THE RAPPER JK IS BACK
3:26 jimin...
3:12 excuse me jungkook-ssi 😐
Tae and JK are the Ninjas who disappeared in the dark.
J-HOPE
"It may seem like they aren’t in sync as much as  they were before, but the reality is that they just developed their own styles over the years, they stand out this way."
0:51 that’s our maknae🤯🤭
A new army without a bias seeing this be like: MY. BIAS. IS. RM
Dang makes you realize how much had progressed Namjoon dhsjsjjsjsjej  fan girling. Hoseok said no one lives today   yoongi RAPPING snsjjss i missed him  JINNNNNNMMNNMMMN HIS LOOKS KILLING ME  .their voices even  then RAPPER JK JK danf  THE DANCE BREAK THEY Said you wish  Jimin said imma flyyyyy and he did  Vs voice is getting deeper every time dnnssnnq  [appricate them all]
So are we just not going to talk about jimin at 3:12 and 3:15?
jikook shippers: *screaming* me: dang thats a nice transparent shirt ya got there jimin
"It makes me very nostalgic to hear them sing their first song ... 7 years later ... my jungkookie looks really sexy in that outfit and with his hair like that, 🤤❤️...his rap is so great ... he's always good at everything 😍 ... I love you Jungkookie 💜💜💜 and without leaving Tae Tae behind who looks very handsome as always beautiful😍❤️🥰 ... I love you Tae  Tae 💚💚💚💚"

Legends say that jungkook still hasn't reached the library 😳
"So here’s the thing, our 8th BTS anniversary goal is to make ""NO MORE DREAM"" hit 1B. I know it sounds difficult but we have to do it. BTS always thought that their debut was not a bop and didn’t want to look back at it. If we army’s, hit it to 1B, they will realize that they were kinds before and now too. Let’s make their debut mv 1B Let’s do it army’s. I know we can, share this in very platform in various languages! Let’s surprise them💜"
Bts 2016: HIP HOP🔥🔥 Bts 2020: HOT SEXY🔥💜

They really should have put  different background for the first half or get Tae and JK different coloured outfits. I could only see their floating heads. 😂😭
"COPYIED, So here's the thing, over 8th BTS Anniversary goal is to make ""NO MORE DREAM"" hit 1B . I know it sounds difficult but we have to do it . BTS always tought that their debut was not a bop and didn't want to look back at it . If we Armys , hit it on 1B , they will realise that they were kings before and now too. Let's make their debut mv 1B. Lets do it Armys. I know we can. Share this as much as you can on every platform and in various language. ARMYS Fighting."

Y yo esperando que Jimin se levante el polo 😭😭🤣😅🤤

I can't believe they still used Taehyung as a chair lmao he's too boss for that shit now
"me da mucha nostalgia escucharlos cantar su primera canción... 7 años después... mi jungkookie se ve realmente sexy con esa vestimenta y con su cabello asi, 🤤❤️ es tan genial su rap... él siempre es bueno en todo❤️😍... te amo Jungkookie 💜💜💜 y sin dejar atras a Tae Tae que se ve muy guapo como siempre hermoso😍🥰... te amo Tae Tae💚💚💚"
I see jimin smiling so cute
The song sounds so incomplete without Army's cheerful screams...
this really shows how much they’ve grew up omg🥺
"Mis niños,que emoción sentí cuando escuché cantar esta canción 7 años después 😓🤧💜LOS AMOOO"
No puedo creer lo mucho que han crecido antes eran una banda más pero ahora es la banda surcoreana más famosa y amada y sin olvidar que tiene el fandom más grande.....  🥺🥺😭😭💖
"I just got back home from school, and I see this? bruh-"
Fact: we can only see one eye of jk and and his jawline Niddle part of taehyung's forehead and lip thats it

So their latest no more dream performance takes it to another level Yeah 🙂
Jungkook talking about the library doesn’t feel the same with that hair and shirt 🙂
I'm waiting for jimin abs😪
Taehyung 2020 version of this is just soooo hot 🥵🤯 0:53
Everyone wear white... Jk and tae let's wear black😅😘

"J-hope, my best dancer...👏 Bts...👍"

If bighit doesn't  let these babies meet bts imma just sue them
i really hope they meet BTS soon . these kids are adorable.
william and bentley: borahae sam: confused af
I find this extremely interesting. What shocked me is when he did his feet like RM does unconsciously while he sits down. I never noticed that. Children are extremely observant. I will be even more careful around them for sure.
please... let these kids meet bts... or not even the whole team... maybe just the 2 boys they really loved from the team RM and V... and let's watch where their conversation going...
I hope that these kids will meet bts soon
"They love bts so much that they even know "" i purple you""  Bighit please let us see bangtan daddy moments"
"When Namjoon stans thought they were the biggest fan of RM..when there's Jungkook and William competing for the first place and who loves and admire Namjoon deeper than his dimples!😭😭 But seriously, William is only 5 yrs old, but how he adores and admire RM is way beyond words. He even knows Namjoons little habits, the Borahae, and he even knows Namjoons birthday!😭 I'm really hoping one day he will get to meet BTS if not, atleast his role model Kim Namjoon. He was sad when they didn't  get to meet BTS when they went to BH.😭"
"You'll  get the chance to meet bangtan in the right time, I'm praying for that💜"
"I really cried when they were writing letters , BTS must have been so happy to recieve it  Has really crying cause he didn't get a perfect heart for BTS  He's so wholesome , Please I want BTS to meet them , I hope once they are free they get the chance"
"Bighit should allow BTS to meet these kids, just once..."
I sooo wish BTS see this and got the letter. They definitely will appreciate it
dad : how old am i? william : 23 years old..  auuch😂😂
Sam really a good father he's
William is LITERALLY obsessed with RM 😂
Who else wants to see a Run BTS: Fatherhood Special? lol cause i know i'm not the only one
I get William... RM is so sweet and beautiful person..so does William..  Both kids are so cute and adorable ❤️
why did william act like me whenever i saw namjoon but hes definitely cuter 😂😭 such a big fat mood
"If my kid wouldn’t act like that , I don’t wanna it"
"💜💜💜💜💜 for our lil army.. n more for BTS for reaching out to these n such innocent kids' hearts through their songs, dance n love n joy from their everyday lives, fun etc.💜💜"
Sam handled the situation so quickly. I'm really amazed. He raised Bently and William so well. I really like how he hugs his kids after something has happened too
I really wish that wilben would meet bts hyungs for real in the future. They must've looking forward to it when they went to bighit.  Fighting wilben babies!
"The way William noticed what RM does with his feet when he sit is sooo~, They even know the ""I PURPLE YOU"""
This is why I keep watching return of Superman even my mom kicking my ass because she want to watch TV news😶📺
Yeonwoon is also army  Let's talk about him to 💜😃
Imagine if william grow up and become an idol    Me : dying of happy 😱😱😱😱
Omg! BTS must watch this especially RM! 💜
"I wish William will surely see BTS because, he really write that letter with blood,sweat and tears 🙏🙏🙏 and i wish that William will see BTS for me because i can't see them in real life 😁😁"
Bh just let bts or at least Rm and Tae meet them for god sake. Is it so hard to grant the little kid's wishes? If Tae knew he would have been so happy to greet them. Namjoon too💜💜💖
They were just kids who keep a lot of hopes abt the things they love..i cant even imagine how would I feel if I was them...kbs should have at least asked bighit for a short video clip for William n bentley...
*“I am WM”* i love that part 🤣
William is like baby hawk army..noticed every single details about RM😍😘
"OMG, If RM loves broccoli, I think William would love it too 😁"
William will be the happiest person to see Rap Mon in real life.
My babies are ARMY.....purahaeyo William and Bentley💜💜💜
Wouwauw William even knows RM Loves noodles 🍝 jjajangmyun
This melts me heart they really need to meet BTS William likes RM and Ben likes V like awwww
"Why William is so cute when he want a perfect shape heart for bts, ahh!! I'm so touched💜"
Aigoo Don't make me cry 🥺 I purple you too 🥺💜💜😭💜💜💜
Wow the effect BTS has on the whole world 😍.  I love that the little kid wants something perfect for his idols 💜💜💜💜💜.  He is just like me 😁🙊
"William is a true fan, he knows even the little details of RM!"
Just imagine this- Dad: how old are you ? Kid: I'm five Dad: how old am I ? Kid: you are old
I love wiliam and bentley and they love BTS.I purple you 💜
I will be waiting for Run BTS Special with Willbengers🥰 Power of ARMY's for petition we can do this💜💜
"The way Bentley apologize to william and say  Bently:I'm sorry william, borahae💜  My heart bounceu 😭💖"
William's bias love for RM is so adorable. Please let them meet!
i mean if not from anything else you can see that William is a true Army by his struggle with making the heart right..thats literally every army trying to make it right for Bts
"Girls don't want boyfriends, they want BTS' reaction video of Wil-Ben 💜"
William is just a calm brother just like rm
I want William and Bentley to meet BTS more than I want to myself (as an ARMY) 💜💜
i have no words...i used to watch William he is my favorite. i never thought I would see him in an episode that has to do with Bts though i dont know why. this is just such a pleasant development!!
This just reminds me of William and Bentley spending quality time with KAI from EXO and Bentley. And Bentley even did an EXO fanchant. And now they love bts too.These boys really stan the kings. ❤
Can u imagine if william will become an idol wow i stan from now😅👍
Quiero ver las caras de BANGTAN cuando los conozcan.
Awww i really wish this two brothers can meet bts someday or sooner they deserve it really bighit please grant their dreams hehehe
HAHAHA WHEN THEY CRIED BC THEY WANTED THE LETTERS TO BE PERFECT TO RM AWHH 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Waiting for the full episode.....💜William and Bentley!!!!
Hell ya RM for the win 🙌

Thấy mấy bạn chửi bangtang quá nên mình cũng kể luôn. Lúc trước khi còn là thực tập sinh ở bithit bts phải sống cuộc sống rất cơ cực. Tới mức 7 người họ chỉ đủ tiền order một chiếc bánh pizza rồi chia nhau ăn. Jimin thường ăn rất nhiều nhưng chỉ được một miếng nhỏ. Vì quá uất ức cậu khóc to thành tiếng. Đúng lúc đó xuất hiện một người phụ nữ bước tới với một chiếc pizza cỡ lớn trên tay. Cô nhẹ nhàng nói : “Các em hãy ăn chiếc bánh này và cố gắng thành công trong tương lai nhé. Chỉ cần có niềm tin các em chắc chắn sẽ làm được”. Nhờ câu nói ấy mà 7 chàng trai đã nổ lực trở thành ngôi sao thế giới như bây giờ. Đâu ai biết rằng người phụ nữ năm đó chính là Võ Hoàng Yến.
NSND là gì vậy ?

ユンギがグクの香水を勝手にふりかけるのを見て、昔「ヒョン、お前(グク)を支配したくてお前のパンツを履いたんだ！」て叫んだユンギを思い出して笑い死にした 支配してるな、今もwwwwwwwww
ジンくん27万するスマホに躊躇なく名前書くところ流石すぎる😇 でも、結局ケースに書いてるのかな？本体に書こうとしてたの自体凄すぎるけど笑
グクめっちゃcooky愛好家やん笑
多分ナムさんのほうが名前書く必要あると思うな。
0:18ジミンがおおおぉっって言ってるのと同時にカメラマン(？)の女の人も(えっマジで書くの、、？)みたいな声出してて笑うwww
2:06 グクの歯ブラシヘッドが 結構大きめでびっくりした。 グクの香水、すぐに品切れしちゃいそうだね。
公式でこの動画出た時、韓国語分からなかったので主さんがこの動画出してくれてすごく助かりました😭 推しが何話してるか分からないのってすごくもどかしいですね😢

ふ
RM maybe the least popular but he is the most important member !!! Fight me
v
V
V also catch my attention  that's why I'm here following  BTS.
I got in to BTS because of Taehyung. Now I love all 7 but Tae is THE BEST!
All members are popular because even without one BTS is not BTS 💜
"KIM TAEHYUNG IS MY BIAS HE IS SO LOVELY, HIS HEART IS SO PURE😭💜💜"
My king Kim taehyung always no 1 🥰🥰🥰🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Ok but I am hurt. The hyung line is so damn underrated. Every members deserves the same. 7-1=0
Taehyung is most popular
Who love v and suga like
Whoever gets to the top my love for V is forever. Just like the sun that waits the morning to shine and sets and again wait for another morning to shine....
V ❤❤
"It's unfortunate, but for the KPop industry the popularity ranking is very important and the status of the members is measured month by month. For now V is the most popular Congratulations V!"
My ultimate bias is Kim Yeontan...
V and Jimin And jungkook and suga
V...u deserve everthing...u deserve No.1💜💜💜🤘🤘🤘
V💜
V said before that fans should love all seven of them equally. BTS are 7. 💜💜💜
I only v in my all life time he is my favourite in BTS he is my everything 사랑해 v 너무 사랑해
"I loved all the Bangtan boys, but V is my bias ever since..❤️💜"
I love you v soooo much 💛💜💛💜
"my bias is hobi and i think he's so underrated : the least lines, and he's the main dancer but he never gets centers. big hit doesn't let him shine and it's upsetting"
My bias is park jimin but I take every member of BTS as equal importance
TAEHYUNG!!!!!!💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Jungkook is my bias and Taehyung is my bias wrecker :)
Jk😍😍😍😍
I am 💯 jungkook based
"Can ya'll just stop fighting plz, army, don't be offended if another army is congratulating their bias like V for example... Why are you guys getting mad at each other, we all know that we love every single one of them equally and we all know they wouldn't want us fighting either, some people just wanted to show their appreciation for that person, so plzz love each other army we stick together... im sorry it had to be said"
Tae is my bias ✋😌
"V It's the most popular internationally, He has the biggest Fanbase And the richest too 💆‍♀️"
My favourite  Junkook
We stan all the 7. 💜💜💜
according the votes Taehyung is the most popular member of BTS.
V
"Jin is my one and only bias since the very begining, and he'll definitely alwayz be my first priority💜 P.S: I truly luv all 7 0f my boyz."
"""V"" ÚNICO💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
V✌️💜💜
"Did you noticed one thing, actually there popularity is RANKING according to their handsome faces....why this discrimination...??? Everyone is equal"
I already know that V will be first 🎉😇😊 But all the members are equal for me and my bias is the one and only........       V(kim taehyung) Baby tiger 🐯🐯 Taetae 😻😻 Taehyung 😇😇
I'm always biased V because I really love him
"Beautiful Prince Kim Tae hyung, and his human quality.  All with a unique talent But the one who stole my heart is HIM.  El príncipe hermoso Kim Tae hyung y su calidad humana.  Todos tienen un talento unico y carisma, pero el que me robo el corazón es él. 🤴💜"
"As always Taehyung caught my eyes, V is the reason I am an Army.... The most handsome man in the world V💜💜💜"
JIMIN fans 👇
V and SUGA ❤💙
Tae is my bias💜
JIMIN is my bias
"V of BTS most popular,famous,loved,liked,favourite,attractive,cutest,handsome fashionable,stylish member in the world alongside (of all time)💜"
V🐻🐯💜
Taehyung Oppa deserves the whole universe but world don't deserves this angel because of some Toxic solo stans who are trying to hate V so that they can bring up their biases !! Love you Taetae !! You are the best !! 💜💜
"My ultimate bias is a JK. He got me interested in BTS. However, all 7 are popular and important in their way. OT7💜💜💜"
Jungkook is my bias he is so lovely and so much handsome
My bias kookie and min suga But ot7🥰
V fans 👇
Jin is my bias. But I love them all💜
Yess I am ot7 but thanks to V I came to Stan BTS n kpop reason he is my ultimate bias.. 🤗🤗💜💜💜 borahae army's stay safe n Yess love all the members equally by #V🤗💜💜
"All of them are talented, but I have to say that Suga and V are two beautiful Minds. If they form a sub unit, they can create music fot the soundtrack of a movie."
"All bts good.. my bias jungkook.. good talent , golden maknae ... So humble in bts... We love you jungkook 💜 and bts..."
yoongi
Jhope is so handsome
Jungkookie
Jungkook is my bias but I love all of them...
I’m biased by Jimin But don’t hate on any of the members bts will not be bts without them
V love you so much and all member
"I become one of BTS because of Tae.   The reason I like him more has nothing to do with how handsome he is but mostly : I love how he loves his members and put them as his priority, his big warm heart when he defence Jin, not being selfish but very caring, his way to talk despite others saying Taetae language ( I deeply understand him). He does nothing to be in front of everyone but easily succeed to be above everyone. His deep romantic voice and love for old but golden songs and my list can continue ... I know BTS is 7 and we need to love of them, which  I do, but he never asked to love them equally, so I will never be ashamed  I love him more"
V 👑
I love all the members of bts but I was interested into the boy group because of V (Taehyung) and I love him so much
i came to know BTS because of Taehyung... and i will follow him . but i love them BTS forever
J-hope is my bias
The multitalented Kim Taehyung
Suga the most adorable
I love bts and my bias is v
I am big fans of vmin 🤩💜
Tae 👑 my bias
Jeon Jungkook. But I love all of them. It's hard.
All 7 members are very important for BTS and Army.
V is my bias
Always jungkook
BTS V is the reason that's why I like bts members.I like V's vocal and all his songs.
Tae is my bias and I’m so proud 🔥💜
The maknae line hits differently
Whether v is popular but for me all the members are equally popular 💜💜
"remember that the boys are not to blame that many Armys ""are toxic Love them all and ignore toxic comments 💜"
My Bias OT7. Impossible for BTS to be as successful as they are now without one of them
My favorite members from bts is taehung.  I guess that in this round the winner is rap monster but there is taehung votes is 1511 233 I was in shocked when taehung votes is more than others than I am very happy🤩🤩
#1 KIM TAEHYUNG!!! 👑
Park jimin moat handsome and cute boy in the universe💜💜💜💞💞💕❤💟💚
I love all the members equally but mu bias is V
V Kim Taehyung hes the reason why i became an Army
Taehyung is my bias 😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘he is very powerful and very nice....🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍
My forever bias is Kim Taehyung 💜
No matter who comes first or last a real ARMY will always love them equally 💜💜💕💕💜
Taehyung is always in no.1
I know that V is always first .I love you V 🤗🤗😘😘
"Taehyung good boy, I'm so proud of him!!!"
Taetae is my bias 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
You all are the first place of ARMY'S heart forever💜️💜️💜️💜️
Jin is my bias !!
V is my bias
V 💜✨

"I don't know, that they can feel the real vibe"
I can not hear what they are saying but I am guessing they would love to have the kind of artistic freedom that Abel has
"Ёбаные эльфы, они существуют)))"
"Nah, it's not their reaction for this song , they didn't had the real vibe of this song ."
Canta hermoso the weeknd .
El del borro negro es muy pensativo 🙂🍃
Weekn way better than them fr
This reaction is for dynamite 💀
Realmente hermoso hasta lágrimas me caso está canción con los recuerdos
O my god one hour ago yay I love new movies on YouTube 😍😍🤩
Amo esa musica ♡♡♡   😌👌
bts 좋아하지만 위켄드는 r&b의 모차르트 같은 사람인데 비교대상은 아닌듯
"ATTENZIONE: THE WEEKND NON HA EFFETTUATO LA CHIRURGIA PLASTICA, MA SI TRATTA DI MAKE UP DI ALTISSIMI LIVELLI, LO HA SPIEGATO ANCHE LA RAGAZZA CHE HA FATTO IL MAKE UP.."
One of the best songs
fakkkkeee
Kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkk🇧🇷
Who knew from the start that this was fake
TA chale the situation ⭐
Esto es más fake que el canal de coscu reacciona xd
They can't sing like this song in their life
Minta tolong ya di simpan yg nama ya BTS 😙😙😙😙
BTS reaction Martin Garrix
i just came form school i just saw this
Reaction?
"Que bien que no hicieron un cover de save your tears, fiu Si lo hacen les pongo kgaste"
why is this soooo fake
They can't even speak English more less understand the song. 💀
Best song ever
Rip to all believe that this is true lmao
Jajaja XD
They wish they were this good lol
Why do u lie
that´s real?
Lol just clicked on this to say this is just bts reacting to something else with this song cropped over it
Who the feq told em to react thes bit*^ses are way too fakin it
CANADIAN BABY
"I LOVE THEM😍😍😩, but this video so damn fake . BYE"
Tiemblen vitiez.
So what song are they really reacting to
North korea wins the war easy
"I HOPE U DELETED THIS CHANNEL, THATS REACTION FAKE"
"I'm a simple ARMY, I see BTS, I click, I comment"
his FACE is plastic duhhh it looks suming out of payday 2
والزق
😂🤣😂🤣😂💔
Who is who
Ok
WTF
Black ip its bts
Es fake o no ???
It’s not real what are they laughing at???
These guys are a joke
"I hate fake reactions,🙄"
Wtf
fake
Interesting persective on a few fronts.  1. From a Japan's persective as these guys have had their music pre-written & have been bred to do this not unlike previous boy bands. 2. In the US it's been noted that boy bands have been cultivated and bred like NSYNC and Lance Bass & The Back Street Boys with Lou Pealman.  TO think that this isn't going on today with these young artist with this much clout on social media would be unforgiven with the right mind.  So to see these kids reacting in favour of an artist like The Weekend and giggling they've been socialised by their upbringing to down talk it.  It's funny how years later that atrists like Cyndy Lapper are really artist of their generation after it's all over after we look back.
Where is the army?
"Hahaha,,,fake,,,"
En el segundo 15 se parece  al de los cabellos azules xD
Omg. Bts

"Hello,lemme know how many armys are here no international armys or Korean armys we are armys together we are bulletproof 💜💜💜"
You are wrong . They make me laugh every second of my life.
Jin: don't bully the spider! Jk: okay! I bully you 😂😂
Jungkook's rrrrrrrap monstarrr is so funny and cute af 😭🤣
"BTS came from a small company,they started with nothing. Jin who was casted just because of his looks, Suga who left his family and gambled his education just to do what he really wanted to be, Namjoon who was never been supported by his parents, Jimin thought himself as ugly and fat , Taehyung whose always been part of BTS but was never shown in any promotions - not until they debut, J-Hope who seemed to always laugh but never felt as accomplishment to his father, And Jungkook who was very shy and has saved his parents at a young age  by auditioning to companies. Remember the days when they were struggling ? They even have to sacrifice and work hard just so they could they eat . They were squeezing themselves into one small apartment and have to take responsibilities - the reason why they wrote the song 'Move'. The day they were almost disband on N.O era because they don't have enough allowance and money to continue , but still they fuoght for there dreams. There was also a time when Bang PD -nim asked Namjoon if he wanted to have a solo career or sacrifice for BTS.He could have choose to be a solo artist since it was his dreams, but he didn't . He said BTS is BTS and they can make it ! Yet, some fans fans telling him to 'leave bangtan' it hurts him alot . Remember those times when they have to use there managers as extras to there MV's because they don't have enough budget. They even asked if they can use or borrow their staffs and managerscars just shoot 'I Need You' MV successfully . Those times when Jimin has to starve himself just because people calls him fat and ugly . That one interveiw Suga said that; it was nice people listen to their music because Taehyung and Jungkook were good looking. And he thought that it was at least enough. Do you remember when J-Hope was supposed to be the vocalist and Taehyung is the rapper , but he choosed to rap instead and learn it because Taehyung wants to be a vocalist ? It was Taehyung's dream and J-Hope loves his dongsaeng that much he would sacrifice . Othet fan base were accusing them for plagiarism just because they had the smallest detail whose the same with other big K-pop groups which is acctually just a coincidence. There was a time when Suga packed 300 gifts and letters just give there 300 fans who will attend at there mini fan meetings. So why people judge them so fastly? Did you know Jimin came all the way   to Seoul from Busan just to persuade his dreams? Did you know Taehyung lived with his grandma gor almost half of his life making him inocent from what else is out there in our world ? Did you know Jungkook set aside his embarressment just meet there other expectations? Yes,he is the golden maknae, but he suffers too when he see his hyungs having a hard time,he cries. And there was a time when Jimin caught him crying and the reason is because he misses his family. Jungkook cries secretly so that his hyungs wouldn't worry. Did you know Jin auditioned to make his mother proud of him and so that his mom would have something to brag off to those judgemental neighbers they have . He worked hard on his vocals yet people called him taletless . Did you know Namjoon worked hard just to produce songs yet there was a time when his mom ruined his computer and broke his mike so he could focus on his study? Did you know that J-Hope auditioned because he wanted his father to proud of him? Because he felt like he was disappointment . Those rookie days when they only listen tk awardings and be amazed by their seniors. They can't do anything but to watch those idols who recieves awards. The day when they were happy with just 300 veiws on YouTube , mini fangathering small numbers of followers , and on Daeseng award. They were contended And now they have reached to the top and became more successful.From 150 fans to 6million and countings, From a small practice room to bigger one , From cramped dorm with roommates to big dorm with each of them having room , From one Daeseng award to more award and they have even won BBMAs. BTS never expected this before their fourth year anniversary , they have come so far that the only chance we have to see them is to go to there concert (NEVER) meet them along the street with 0.01% chance. But really Armys ! We have come this far fam, Lets love them and give them our support till the end! I wanted to thank you all. I love you fam! I love BTS. Lets stay together until the end if you believe in what i have said . If you believe in 1! 2! 3!  A truse ARMY shall spread this ~."

"Honestly, the sound effects are the best things ever."
"So here's the thing, our 8th BTS anniversary goal is to make ""NO MORE DREAM"" hit 1B. I know it sounds difficult but we have to do it. BTS always thought that their debut was not a bop and didn't want to look back at it. If we armys, hit it to 1B, they will realise that they were kings before and now too. Let's make their debut mv 1B Let's do it armys. I know we can . Share this as much as you  can on every platform and in various languages."

Yoongi & Jk are like are you sure we belong here cause I don’t know them
Tell me why i realized it was a stray kids song the second time watching this... I’m embarrassed for myself    Sry fellow stays
I'm like Yoongi at all the parties and ceremonies in my family every year 🤣😂💜
Pobre yoongi traingale una almoada y una sabana
I like they way youngi stares . As if some one forced him to eat some thing he doesn't likes
RM's swag and coolness is no joke😳
Suga and kookie's mind be like *why are we here just to suffer?* 😂😂
Yoongs being like when it's math class.
Suga is always that one friend😂😂
Jungkookie's mind:  Why they started dancing like jungle men.what's wrong??? Mom I am scared! Oh I will cry now. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jungkook and Suga be like: oof I am not a part of this i- I can't
I'm Yoongi at any family functions//*(+_+)*//

*Letters in BTS=3* *Letters in ARMY=4* *3+4=7* *We're seven when we're with you. We're together forever!! 💜💜*
2:58 jin's part hurts so much :(
2:00 hit hard... “we were only seven... but we have you army.”ilysm bts
3:07 3:21 and some people say jimin DOESN’T KNOW how to use his voice huh? Sorry to say but you are really having some serious problem with your ears if u think so.
"*Their smile make me smile* *Their laugh make me laugh* *Their tears make me cry* *Their existence make my heart flutter boom boom<3*  *I purple you BTS X ARMY and never forget:""you nice, keep going"" 💜*"
"V SAID THAT : ""BUT WE HAVE YOU ARMY""  AND ME AND ARMY SAY: ""WE ARE, WE ARE FOREVER LOVE YOU""😭😭😭😭"
"I mostly don't cry,but this song make me emotional and gives me goosebumps even after listening to it so many times😔😔  Edit:Thx for 322 likes I never get likes more than 3 or 4"
"Kim Namjoon was first member to join BTS. His mom opposed him joining BTS because she wanted him to study well. He used to work so hard with the productions yet his mom would break his computers and mics so that he would concentrate on his studies.  Kim Seokjin , who joined because of his visuals, got criticized that he had no talent in singing but he proved all of them wrong. He wanted to make his mom proud and wanted his mom to have something to brag about her son to their judgmental neighbors. Min Yoongi , whose parents didn't support him well in his music career, had to manage his life on his own. If he had to take the bus, he didn't have money to eat. If he spent it on food, he couldn't take the bus. But now, he's earning millions. Jung Hoseok  had earlier auditioned in JYP but was not accepted in the later half. Being a street dancer and having so much talent, he almost gave up and wanted to leave BTS but his members apposed him in that and he definitely didn't let them down. Yet, he was judged because of his visuals. He auditioned because he wanted his father to be proud of him. Park Jimin , who had to starve himself only because people called him 'fat'. He came all the way from Busan to persuade his dreams and used to practice so much that once he slept for only 3 hours. That is what has made him perfect today. Kim Taehyung lived with his grandmother for 15 years to support her in her farm. He had always been a part of BTS but was never shown in any promotion-not until they debut. Taehyung said he used to practice filming log so that when he's finally announced as a member he can do a lot of for his fans. Jeon Jungkook came to Seoul from Busan in  a very young age persuade his dream. He even traveled all the way to America to learn dancing. Once Jimin caught him crying alone and when Jimin asked why, Jungkook said that he misses his family. BTS , they might be global legends today but they had their own hardships too. So please stop calling them overrated and learn to respect them. They deserve what they're getting today."
"I just became an army November 9th, 2020 and best decision ive ever made💜"
My fav song from album 💿
Jungkook's mic be hurting my eyes with all those pretty purple sparkles 😳💜
Welcome back suga. I'm crying.
We were only 7💜 (BTS) but We have u all now❤️(Army)  We r we r together bulletproof ❤️💜 (BTS+Army)=Family 💜❤️
"When they say, ""we were only seven, but we have you now"" 😭😭😭😭 my heart."
Jimin's raw emotions are almost overwhelming.
WE ARE BULLETPROOF ARMY✊
Bruh Jimin is soo good at vocals also I like his high note
Tae changed the lyrics As  We were only seven Now we have u army It was awesome I literally cried hearing that💜💜💜💜
You can see the sincerity in their eyes while they are singing this especially Jungkook 💜💜✨✨✨  Thank you BTS for existing in this world ✨✨✨✨✨  I’m facing depression now and thx to them I made it through and survived me I thank Jimin for that the most I thank all but the most I’m thankful for is Jimin his past is the most similar to mine and I thank him for saving me and many other ARMYS who are facing depression        To whoever is facing depression: Think of why you are borned in this world   You are borned to be yourself not perfect or someone else  💜💜💜💜✨✨✨✨✨  And if you die we ARMYS...millions or people will also die inside...because losing one ARMY is like losing a part of the Purple Heart that we created using the love of ARMY and BTS together 💜💜💜   If you die our heart will be chipped our beautiful Purple Heart 💜 will not be perfect anymore         So please don’t think you’re nothing because you’re a part of us ARMY now and that makes you a SOMEONE not a NOTHING it means you are part of a beautiful big and perfect family 💜💜💜💜   You: 💜💜💜  Me: 💜💜💜  BTS: 🖤💜🖤💜💜🖤💜💜🖤🖤💜💜💜💜🖤💜     ARMY: 💜✨🖤💜🖤🖤💜🖤✨✨🖤✨✨✨✨✨💜✨✨✨✨🤍🤍🤍🤍💜✨💜🖤💜✨🖤🤍✨   ✨✨✨     Be yourself  Speak yourself  Love yourself  💜💜💜💜
Bts have 3 letters Army have 4 letters  3+4=7 We are only seven...when we are forever with you..we are together💜
Thanks 💜💜 guess who’s crying lol
"Wait, I didn't cry when teahyung said we all have you ARMY. That hits hard. Love you bts"
I want to know who was that guy who said Jimin looks ugly😡. Jimin looks so stunning
2:25 jiminie 💜
"If we’re crying watching this in our beds, imagine if we watched this live We would all heard each other sobbing"
2:00 bro i didn't need any more reasons to cry
I’m crying cause it was sad that we couldn’t see them in person
I always cry when I listen to this song...😭😭 I will always love them 💜
This song will never fail to make us cry
2:04 - 2:09 🥺🥺🥺🥺      😭😭😭😭😭😭 I love you BTS💜💜💜
I love this song.  The way BTS delivers the message and hits the notes is just beautiful.  I cry tears of joy every time I hear it.  The song has more meaning now than it did before 3/14/21
If you didn’t sob 😭 when tae said we’re seven but we have you army then you don’t have no soul
"""BTS"" YA NO SON SOLO 7, TODO EL PLANETA LOS ACOMPAÑA Y ESCUCHAMOS SUS CANCIONES Y MIRAMOS COMO BAILAN."
if you knew feelings you would understand 🥺 The moment jimin started singing I just barst out crying over and over again 😭😭😭😭😭
Like I said before once you jimin you can’t Jim out
"I randomly saw this video on my timeline, I was in awe with vocals and emotions. When I searched for the English lyrics, I was blown away. Whatever these boys went through, where they are now is not where they are meant to be because they are meant to soar higher."
Yo automáticamente cuando escucho a jimin cantar :                                                                              Yo: JIMIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm not crying just cutting the onions in a really weird way and sneezing 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
"I keep listening to this song. this song makes me cry😢😢  We love BTS last , now and Forever 💜💖❣️   We're only Seven ,  but we have you  Army this Make me cry 😢"
"I'm proud of them that they make this song . I really like this song . I am malay my korean not well so I can't understand many, this song is 😭😢"
Every member sang there heart out and we ARMY definitely felt it
Jimin you look so hot and handsome 💜
They all are very hardworking. I'll never forget them. BORAHAE BTS
V SAID BUT WE HAVE YOU ARMY. Me and ARMY: I PURPLE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️
Antes eran 7 ahora son muchos  y los acompañaremos hasta el final los queremos mucho todas las army
"I became an army on 1 June 2020 and That was the best decision I have ever made. And now I am a crying mess , whenever I listen this song this always makes me cry  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭."
this song will hitt soo much when they will sing it with actually real army in a real concert!!! cant wait for that 😭💜
I can't believe that it almost been a year since map of the soul album out!!!
2:31 seokjin💜
Jk's and V's voices are just so amazing.
"I refused any motion that said MOTS era has ended until we chant ""we are we are together bulletproof"" together in the stadium."
"We Are Bulletproof The Eternal es una hermosa canción, BTS siempre hace arte :)"
"You can just change my mood anytime you want BTS I can cry, smile, laugh very hard,feel excited and any other behaviour at any time only because of you💜❤ You have full control on my heart beats. You can even give me heart attack. 😋 You are my everything. Love you all 💗"
Tae = we are we are together bulletproof  Kookei = we are we are forever bulletproof ❤️
"At the time of this concert on October 10, 2020, I joined as ARMY with all of you, so every time I hear this song it really cries, I love you BANGTAN and I love you ARMY😊💜💜"
"Estaba tan tranquila escuchando UGH! en Spotify y me sale esta recomendación no me pude aguantar, ahora estoy llorando. PORQUE ME HACEN ESTO!!,"
"I swear when the song starts at 0:01, my heart aches 😭"
I'm literary gonna cry.
ARMY you are only 7💜 But our army world Milena's 💜 ARMY 💜 BTS 💜 for evear 💜 Bulletproof ARMY 💜 ARMY world 🌐💜is soo beautiful 🌟
Imagine how army's would feel if bts sing this song at their concert. I guess all army's would be emotional
Ulan su canlı konsere bile giremeyecek kadar şanssız püh şansıma tüküreyim dedim konsere katılanları gördükçe                              Tr-army
The fact that they sang as perfectly as they did when they recorded the actual song 😭
"I’m crying so much right now. This song is so precious 🥺 “we were only seven, but we have you ARMY."" Amazing, just amazing. BTS forever."
On 2:21 Jimin was so emotional that his vocality lost at word anymore
i cannot have boyfriend but when i know bts i release that they r my boyfriend❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜😭😭💜💜💜💜💜💜💜😭😭😭😭👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I used to cry in loneliness and sadness but after becoming an army I only cry in happiness 💜
Какие они здесь все красивые!!! Чимину очень хорошо с открытым лицом! 😍
Lindoooooooo BTS TE AMO SARANGHAE
Jungkook has been looking like from another planet. like some high evolved specie that came to earth to grace us with his heart. his eyes... beautiful performance bts
"Son solo siete .... Que nos dicen cosas hermosas, nos enseñan a valorarnos y cuidarnos , casi siempre se muestran alegres aunque algunas veces esten mal, yo deseo que toda la ola de desprestigios y mentiras de parte de algunas malas personas , pare ,y que los chicos sean fuertes una vez mas..... BTS  los amo....."
I Love You BTS ❤️🇰🇷❤️
"Okay Everyone I get it Tae said ""We were only seven, But we have you ARMY"" What about Jin who said it before Tae on 0:48🥺"
"you know how many times I’ve seen this video? Like 3 o even 2 times, this presentation literally makes me cry every time. I see the members are trying hard not to cry and seen them like that just makes me cry so much that I can’t watch this"
I know V changed the lyrics we are only 7 now we have army's💜💜😭
BTS+ARMY=FOREVER FAMILY  💜

"I'm crying!!!😭😭😭 2:00 ""we were only seven, but we have you army, "" 😭😭😭 who else"
"I love these BTS boys they are strong and very brave, let's go bulletproof together"

welcome Suga I hear you at the surgery I really cry every night 😭😭😭😭
This one hits an emotional chord inside
Can we just talk about all the emotion in this song 🤧😭😔
_succeed only_ _happens_ _If_ _They_ _Start_ _To_ _Talk_ _Negative_                                         _-_ _Kim_ _Soekjin_
BTS + ARMY = love for ever ...
Sometimes I find it hard to believe that Jungkook’s voice is actually that perfect. But then I remember it is. And that alone makes my brain explode.
2:20 omg jimin...😋😋😮😮😮
I started crying when the song start😭😭😭😭😭💜 Love this song so much. ARMY4EVER We are forever bulletproof
Que música senhor  😢🇧🇷💜
Jimins vocal omg😍😍😍😍💜💜💜💜💜💜❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"This song make me cry,what a song. Jimin vocal is awesome.  We are bulletproof."
This song hits hard in your emotions cause it's sad and meaningful I love you BTS 💜💜💜💜💜😭😭
Наши парни повзрослели-глаз не оторвать!!!! 🤩😍
"Must be hard singing this song and have the army in front of them through online, must be very emotional"
I’m not going to lie they sound really sad that we aren’t there in person for this song... kind of made my cry lol because I know it’s hard for them to not be able to hear their fans and interact with them while on stage and meet and greets.. those positive interactions between old army and new are what drive our idols.. I hope they can keep their heads up ;-;
BTS we love you so so much l cant even  Explain how much we love you💜💜
We are bulletproof the eternal 💜 A. R. M. Y + BTS = family 💞 ARMY FOREVER 👉💜👈
Taehyungie
This guys already marked 💜  singing greatfully to army. Thats why 7 members are blessed more than they ever dream of. Its just starting wait till this pandemic is over☝💪👏🙏🙏🙏🙏
The only ships that are good: Jhope x Sprite Jungkook x banana milk Tae x Gucci Jimin x Floor Jin x Food Rm x Crab Suga x Cats Suga x Sleep Jin x Mirror
the only ship that's real:  *TaeTae x Gucci*
Seriously even Jungkook said Taehyung is afraid of hanging out with him because of this. These crazy shippers are putting a long term friendship at risk. Please stop
taehyung sees jungkook as a younger brother imagine someone was making sexual scenarios about you and your brother
"Everyone should stop this, it is literally bad"
*Those who make 21+ ff abt them will never EVER pass tae's vibe check*
"It’s so disgusting, disrespectful and delusional. Real fans wouldn’t do this."
My respect for Taehyung went 📈📈📈📈📈📈
"The problem isn’t the fanfiction, it’s the toxic army’s who ships the members"
"A reminder: They can *also* read.      Edit: Y'all are really mad over this?  You get mad over a female idol x BTS ships but you're okay with shipping them? wtf?  Alright, BTS X BTS ships are okay, wtf is with sexualizing them?  (Well I'm no one to tell you what to do, go read those stupid stuff if you're into it. But that IS wrong.)"
It's ok to read fanfic but everything have limits like who is making fanfic they can make ff like funny or horor but don't get that far
No one: Literally no one: SM: let's do a FF contest
Two ships that are real: TaetaexGucci JinxHisMirror
"Okay, so I've read a lot of comments and wanted to make things clear, that some people didn't understand. First of all, English is not my first language, so don't be mean, because of mistakes, that I've made, I hope you get my point anyways. So first of all, that's an issue, that's going around in this whole fandom, not only this comment section, but everywhere from time to time.  1) Don't assume that the members are straight and don't assume, that the members are gay, I personally think it's none of our business, to know, and I hope someday, they will have enough courage, to tell us, which sexuality they have. And in the end, we don't have the rights to say ANYTHING, we should support them, no matter, what. 2) **To all the people talking in the commentsection, not only delulu taekookers, but everyone, V wasn't responding to a simple comment, hé found on weverse, he asked ARMY, if they know a way, to fall better asleep and this person responded, that he should look at pictures, of jungkook, whom he loves. Sooo, I think, this fanwar could have been stopped, if the whole story was explained in the first way, in the video, but I hope since I made this explanation, people will stop. So all in all, it wasn't a overprotective and jealous Taehyung, but Taehyung, who told a delulu shipper, to stop, because it's not good in her imagination world.** 3) I don't think ships are a bad thing, if you don't take it too far and bother the members or anything. I think fanfics in particular aren't that bad either, if you don't put the members down, **because, they are real human beings** ! Even, if they didn't say anything about shippings, we as fans should know our limits! They don't belong to us, they are free to decide, we can not decide, what they should do, or what they shouldn't!  Okay, that was just a small paragraph about what I think and what I think, are goes and no goes. But the most important part for me was, that the weverse comment is clear. Thank you and I purple you 💜💜💜💜💜💜 STREAM DYNAMITE AND LIFE GOES ON!!!! BYE"
It be mainly the ones who say “ Y’all disgusting for writing those” etc. But be the mains ones subscribed and reading those same fanfictions✋🏽
I hate when people do not respect the idols. THEY ARE ALSO HUMANS. Plus they are also like BROTHERS why would they SHIP THEM. IT IS DISGUSTING 🤢
Stop posting moaning things claiming it’s then or “I bet he’s top or he’s bottom” these boys are human and it’s disgusting. Not to mention they are still young.
"I swear! Y'all haven't seen Instagram, yet! IT'S INSANE IN THERE!!! Literally the delusional taekookers are there."
I think there's no problem in writing Fanfics as long as you don't ship them in real life. They are just friends/brothers
"You see the reality is, hey if you wanna show that “Hey Tae and Jungkook’s love for each is beautiful”, then you see them as brothers, you see them as really close friends. Not you, writing smuts, making videos and adding moaning sounds so called “trying” to see them as lovers, that’s not “Friendship/brother love” that’s just you objectifying and sexualizing them for what they just have which is “Brother Love”. And I’m really not someone who trying to make another person feel bad because I know there’s a lot of ff writers on here who don’t do that, some of them don’t even write smuts at all. But if you’re ff writer, and you try to make them look like a “couple” or “love makers” then it really is damaging to them who are suffering from it. Point blank period, that’s not what their bond is. You’ve created this “trend”, thinking it’s appropriate to take two grown men and have them fucking each other which tells people that you are a toxic army and don’t need to be apart of this fandom. Jungkook doesn’t even post as much any more because a 12yr old army sexualized him with his favorite drink which is banana milk. And that was so disgusting and sickening because she sexualized it by turning banana milk into a liquid coming out of a boy’s “private part”. Obviously this 12yr old has mental problems and isn’t a true army. She’s fucked up and dumb for that shit. So if you are an ff writer and you only write about one member even if there’s a love scene, that’s one thing. But sexualizing two men who only see each other as brothers? Take that shit and shove it up your ass because you aren’t an army, you’re a predator and don’t need to be on YouTube or around BTS."
I have mixed feelings about fanfiction (I write myself) but it seems like rps is different as it's entirely sexual right? I've already had a big argument about fans objectifying taehyung- I like actually blew up- so i think it's the same as usual some fans need to know when the line is drawn. it's a feeling of entitlement
"Ship them like brothers or friends not sexually. Edit- If someday these ships come true then also I will be happy and will always support them but don't assume anything right now. If BTS is happy, ARMY is happy."
Person : why do you love BTS they are gay. Me : do you have a sibling? Do you hug you sibling? Do you sit next to your sibling? Do you hold hands of your sibling? Do you give I love you message to your sibling? Person : yes Me : does that mean you're couple? Person : speechless.
I'm not a huge fan of BTS but I feel bad that they're going through this
I ship     Jhope×Snakeu :)     Hamburger and Sprite: *Am I a Joke to U?*
"Taehyung loves Jungkook just like a brother *NOT* like a boy friend , so please Just SHUT UP 🤫"
I like the way Taehyung replied that person right away without ignoring the comment.
"literally, its weird and gross like do u not think they don’t see that stuff, imagine being and their shoes and seeing that"
"Some people don't understand what is the actual meaning of friendship....they all are like brothers, ....but don't know why some people don't understand that and do this type of nonsenses....... Taehyung oppa 's reply is perfectly correct....."
"Yeahhh shipping idols is super weird...like taekook, vmin?? Namjin? They just act like one big happy family to me like brothers? Not like oooh they're secretly married or dating?? That's weird..."
Our Taehyung And jungkook inspire us by their brotherhood and friendship. #Best buddies
"the whole ""y/n"" is gross....its literally disgustinggggg...how tf can anyone post thiss we stan v confronting the commenter"
"I really hate that type of fan fiction, I only search for clean fan fictions that has no ships, love or anything I read one about us being the eight member and how our friend ship is strong and stuff and how much they all care about each other yeah I'm not shy to say I'm reading fan fics as long as they have nothing wrong in them (no shipping, no love, no marriage and dirty stuff) I only read this fan fic because it's so clean and it keeps me warm when I'm lonely, I be able to imagine not being lonely and how interesting living with them could be. Just appreciate the boys for who they are and stop shipping they're brothers, a family but not in the other ways. 💜✨"
"The fact, I write fanfiction but the thing is, I never imagine any idol the way I write. I think of random people but just using their names.... I need to change my wattpad stories to regular people lol."
It’s sad he can’t even be close to his best friend without being shipped and sexualised
Tbh I find it disgusting how people sexualize real people
"Those people who write such ffs I want to ask them  ""How will you feel if someone ships with your bestfriend?"""
i think that's the reason why taehyung became quiter from end of 2019 and till mid of 2020.... let them live guys....
The most underrated ship in BTS       Suga × iced Americano
We all are with you Taehyung . We respect all male idols . We all are with you forever 🙂😊
"BTS are our BangTan boys, as army we should protect them, that’s the main reason why we all are army.. because we need to protect the BangTan Sonyeondan.. Who’s with me?"
"Bruh there’s a difference between writing a fan fiction with a little smut and writing a whole porn book, especially when it’s between members wth, don’t write things between people who are so close with each other, they will probably be awkward with each other and even feel bad. It’s ok if it’s an innocent little flirt or something but 1 tell the readers it’s fiction and none of it is true and 2, please don’t write heavy uncomfortable smut Edit: also don’t involve the members of a same group in heavy relationships too much, it’s weird"
"for all those that are making *IMAGINE* CLIPS WITH OUR BANGTAN BOYS, yall now need to *IMAIGNE* HOW THEY MUST BE FEELING SEEING WE MAKING THESE STUFF..."
I think the girl was crazy who posted the comment about V and JUNGKOOK.......V did a great job by replying her comment and telling the truth!! 👍
"I honestly agree, writing that stuff is gross and an invasion of personal privacy. Why is no one thinking for the feelings of the person they write about? If I were V, I would be firm too, in fact, he's a lot more mild than i would be. I hope people can start respecting and loving idols as the people they are, rather than the objects they treat them as."
It's really disgusting how some fans do this kind of things.
"I actually avoid reading any fanfictions that are related to them, I know some are really well-written and are really good stories, but I find it weird that they're writing a fanfiction based on real people. Aren't you worried that they will see it? How do you think they'll react?"
It's literally a big issue now............Even when i see such kind of things it makes me feel really uncomfortable
What Tae replied to that person got me schoked. That's ma boy.People should stop with this shit and stop making idols uncomfortable.
SM ENTERTAINMENT IS LITERALLY BLOWING MY MIND💀I M GOING NUTS 💀ITS SO CRINGE
"BTS are human and we're human too If people post these moaning things, and the viewers keep watching them... Those viewers would think different about BTS! This is ruining BTS's reputation and it's about time they stop"
Tae speaks truth👏🏼👏🏼I’m glad at least one of the members calls people out. I feel like he’s the only one who isn’t afraid of these “fans”
We trust you🐯 v and jk🐰 no matter what so keep going with your career👍👍👍💜💜💜💜 fighting✊
I think as being a part of fandom we should take responsibility to stand against this behaviour and report these gross things. The ppl who make these weird dillusioned content are so selfish and they don't even care about how uncomfortable are our idols with it. A true fan will never do this because they respect their idol's feelings
I don’t get it ITS DISGUSTING 🤢 y’all nastyyyy as heck. Like tf.. there human so are we.
That’s why tae and kookie has being distant all this time....
"I haven’t read a fan fiction in a year, and I have never read something like “taekook” “vmin” so I wasn’t aware that it was more than a simple friendship idea. It’s crazy how weird people can be"
"I never read fan fictions, I never shipped the members, I think most of the fan fictions are trash, disgusting and insane, these fictions are ruining friendships and the idols' mentally health and their lives, people has to stop with this.."
"It doesn’t matter how sure you are about taekook, if they haven’t said anything it’s none of your business, periodt!"
"We, the real Taekookers are just happy to see them both togather as true friends,with whom they share both of their's happy and funny time. Not like that disgusting way.... isn't it??💜💜💜And thanks for your likes.."
"I understand shiping people with themselves, but not doing it with members bre-"
hard Stan's have crossed the line!!!!PLS THIS CAN CAUSE THEIR FRIENDSHIP BREAK DOWN
"That's the reason of Idols became depression mostly, they didn't know that just their imagination make them hurt and depressed please stop torturing their mind 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"
I kept getting twitter suggestion of that Taekook fiction when I don't even want to see it. It keeps popping out.
It's ok to be a hard Stan but know your limits +Especially who ship's the member sexually.. +OMG thank you for the likes^_^
The reason i suddenly became soft stan :
A reminder: you can read fanfics but remember that it doesn’t apply to real life
Omg just imagine how uncomfortable idols must had felt after watching these videos.  Guys it's a request report these kinds of fanfics and shipping videos!!
"He never said that though, ""it was come out of ur imagination, it's not good there"". And he wasn't referring to fanfiction. He said he wasn't sleeping and i think someone said that he should get jungkook or jungkook would help him sleep or something weird like that."
That awkward moment when you suspect Tae has seen this video and commented on it GAAAAWWWWDDD help us all!!!!! 😩😩😩
"Okay army's promise me that if we see something like this i.e., shipping them sexually, we would react and would protect our idols. Actually not only for army's but every fandom. We would protect them from these psychos. Okay!!"
What's with these ppl ugh !  I'm feeling depressed thinking that we made sad our own idols 😭😭😭😭😭
Just recently I saw an almost an hour long video of taekook analysis. The amount of views and comments are just.. disgusting. I can't imagine how the boys would feel once they saw those kinds of videos and fan fics.
they are brothers..   its disgusting when you ship them sexually
"Some people litterally sexuallises them,they can also read and can feel uncomfort... be human😑"
"To all those people reading or writing fanfic about their ships or featuring them, just imagine what if someone wrote such a fanfic about u??"
I just cant imagine how taehyung would have felt after seeing or reading that type of ff and the way he expressed his thought was really impressive to me.....
"I have a lot to say about this topic, so please hear me out. I think I can give a different perspective on this from a writer's standpoint.  As a fanfiction writer who pretty much only writes bts boyxboy, I have to say that I personally find writing smut VERY uncomfortable. I physically can't. I tried writing it once about jikook because my followers wanted me too (not because I wanted too) and I think and ended up lowkey having a breakdown on the floor in disgust about what I had written. Needless to say I deleted it before finishing  When it comes to fanfiction writing, I keep to one otp and NEVER write sexual stuff. I don't think there's anything wrong with writing fluff or romance though. Feel free to @ me but I think writing romance and domestic fluff is completely normal, I think it's a good thing if it's sfw. Please don't pin this stigma about fanfics on all writers because the majority of us only write cute, fluffy, sfw fics.  Lot's of people don't know this, but from experience most writers in the bts fandom feel obliged to write smut even if they feel uncomfortable for it, since the readers want it and they see it everywhere. People usually don't want to write smut, they just do because they feel like they have too (I'm not talking about pwp's or lemons btw, that's pretty bad). So no, I don't think those types of writers deserve to be punished. Unless they're posting it where bts can see it like on twitter or instagram. That's different.  Not all of us write about sexual stuff and even if people do, they aren't sickos, they're just writing what they see everywhere, things that are normalized on places like wattpad or ao3. And please don't shun or insult fanfiction writers or call their writing trash, it really hurts because people work very hard to write the very same things you are calling disgusting."
"Honestly, I think real people should be off limits with these kinds of fiction. It’s real creepy and extremely uncomfortable."
"I was about to making fiction about how BTS was successful. No smut, no 18+, no sexual harassment, no ship, no privacy information. Its isn't illegal, right? BTW its based on a true story. But I change it just a lil to make it different. I won't say about their privacy life or something illegal like that. I'll just write about how they successful, how they love their fans,  how they managed to roast haters, the lyrics, the songs, how funny they are, how talented they are. Don't worry I'll write it in my books and not sending it to wattpad, youtube and other application :) Its take a years to make it :v But I won't give up"
"there's alot about taehyung and jk  as ""mafia"" srsly why i wish i could slap the creators"
The only thing which is true is  Jungkook x banana milk🥛
When you are a famous celebrity you can't really control this type of things from happening so he don't need to be too bothered by it.
Im not a Bts fan but i'm feeling bad for them bcs of some fans writing sexual FF. I didn't even know they ship them like TaeKook etc. They seeing each other as a brothers like that.      I just notice some anime in there. Didn't expect that :D
I have a friend who is still a teenager and she reads jk smuts. I'm one year older than her. I feel really disgusting when she says Those things.  I only ship vmin but as friends. You know their ultimate soulmates.
They all raised junkook and he is always there little brother...... Even the 6 members attended his graduation as his brothers ...... Real armies can't even think about shipping any of them.... 💜💜💜💜💜💜
I bet u guys haven’t seen how many taekook books are in wattpad it’s insane
Its like... first they can't even look at girl idols because of shipping but now they can't be friendly with male idols either due to these crazy fanfics
"some of these taekook shippers that sexualize the boys are so delusional like they don't listen to people telling them that it's uncomfortable for the boys. Im convinced that taehyung and jungkook could literally say the words ""stop it, we're uncomfortable"" and some taekook shippers will still continue to do it because they fetishize them."
as someone who reads fanfiction i feel so guilty. i don’t actually ship idols seriously but i still like reading stories that include them and i know it’s not right. i can understand how uncomfortable that would make them. god i really need to stop
Stop creating weird fan fics army's borahae 💜
"Especially fanfics that portray the members as abusers, cold husband that beats his wife, rapists etc!! Like just no...it’s pretty much defamation and young people creating these fanfics or reading them need to learn that it’s not ok!! Also ship members as friends or Bros but don’t assume their sexuality by shipping them with their own members or other idols!! 🙏💜"
I actually don't read or love those type of  insane fanfictions I can't imagine how uncomfortable they would have been if I felt uncomfortable
"I'm a taekook shipper, I just love their friendship.❤️"
"Little girls these days should learn about respect and empathy. They should be aware that idols are real people with feelings, real personalities, and real life."
"Someone on my fyp yesteday was shipping all the members together and was like ""yoongi's m0@n is so soft""  Like wtf is wrong with some ppl they Go on sexualizing celebs...-"
Yeah..it's right.....that we can make fanfiction but why sexuality should come...can't we make good ones..☹😟🙁
Ya'll know that girl who makes videos saying she's married to Taehyung? It's really insane and creepy..  edit 1: It's getting out of hand
I'm so uncomfortable 😭 Guess where I found this 🌚😭😂
"Me who just know what is sexual fan fictions     It’s weird         I don’t even read my textbooks then what the hell is those fan fictions infront of me      I’ll never go to this dark culture of fans,            NEVER              Thanks for reading this sh*t"
"I like watching the bts, to remind me that these are really good actors and behind the scene they can all be really silly."
3:51 I feel like there is something going on between these two... he always keeps his hands on her way too longer hahaha
2:48 uwaaaa his visuals T^T
So excited for season 2😍😍😍
3:50 AHHCCKK LEE JI AH SO PRETTY😭
I have legit fallen in love with Lee Ji Ah 😍
It’s weird seeing  them like this and acc getting along
I don’t know how many people like this there are only 2 or 3 dislikes.
Who ships Lee Ji Ah and Uhm Ki Joon in real life?
LEE JI AH IS SOOOOOO PRETTYYYY <3
Thank you so much for eng sub ❤️
thanks for the subs!!❤
Can't believe that intense scene of the party was acted in these vibes of comfort and laughter 😂 I've come to see BTS to remind myself it's all acting! Good Job to all drama workers especially the director 👏👏

Did tae actually have a peircing tho?  If yes  U did amazing tae tae
"I honestly love Jenny so much, like her character development really said📈📈"
"The girl who acted as Ha eunbyeol was really amazing. Her acting was on point, from her anxious expression to almost insane expression. She will become amazing actress"
We need the kids interaction 😭
I hope The Penthouse kids appear in running man 😍
Is it funny that I still want to spank those kids for bullying Ro Na and Seol A?They are indeed best actors and actresses!
You came to watch the behind the scene becuase of your anger didn’t you?
I can't just imagine SeoJin here just sharing her candy but I almost killed her in front of my tv hahahahah
0:21 the height difference XD
I only watched until 2 episode yet and I was surprised at how much angry I was while watching it. I need to check my blood pressure. It must be high due to anger.
Eunbyeol & Rona: 🤬😤👿🤛🏾 🙄😬😑😰 Yebin & Hyunsoo: 🥰☺️🙂😊😇🥳🤩🤪
Watching this to remind myself that I can’t be mad at them 😂 oh they play their roles so well!  Can’t wait to see more work from everyone.
The kids in real life are really adorable & cute 😍
I needed this to lessen my anger at some of the characters.
The actors for the kid roles are all really amazing. Eun byeol’s actor is absolutely so talented. She does a great job of expressing her emotions
Choi ye bin is really tall and beautiful
Choi Ye bin is really good. I actually got scared of her facial reaction
The actress who played min seol a is absolutely pretty.
"Ha Eunnbyol is the character I hate the most, but actually she's really adorable😂"
I ship ji hyun and young dae !!!!!
"Honesty ever actor in the penthouse was in point, like their character suited them very much that you want to hit them. Them showing so much emotion really made me think I’m watching an real life event. All those people will be very good actors I just know it"
I'm waiting season2 💔😥
when Cheon Seo Jin in real life is THE SWEETEST among all
y'all imagine how this is just only Eunbyeol's(Choi Ye Bin) debut acting
"Why do I feel that seok hun is really having crush on ro na , just a feel"
"Han Ji Hyun unnie, (Joo Seok Kyung) she is so pretty and cute. I absolutely adore her😍😍. She is too adorable. I wish i could personally know her or be friends with her. Her personality is really awesome. Jinjja Daebak! Her fashion style too. Literally my type."
I love the chemistry of Minhyuk's mom & dad w Jenny's mom. They're so funny
They they're oh so innocent in the behind the scenes unlike the drama lmao
She shared the candies omg she's so sweettt
"3:47 "" shall we overturn the table"" ksjskskjsk"
cheon seo jin is so kind..in real ife of course..
The mean characters in the drama: 😈😈 them in real life: 🤗
It more wierd that they are loughing and caring for each other of the set. Like we see the whole when it is edit but for them it is like one shot amd cut and wow like they dont feel it
I can't wait for season 2. Very excited to watch this.: D
"2:22 cheon seo jin's change her facial expression that fast when she heard ""get ready."""
3:01 i needed this so much
YOO THEIR ACTING IS SO GOOD
They played their roles so well I need to check my blood pressure 🤯🤯
I came watch behind the scene because i angry so i want to see how they filming the penthouse drama 😌
their  character is so scary but in the real they so sweet lol.
Seok hoon's smile😭😭❤
the actress who plays Ha Eunbyul is very talented!perfectly fulfills its role
"Theyre all amazing actors/actresses especiall eunbyeol's, cheon seo jin's, and seok kyung's (i forgot the actresse's names)"
I need this to control my anger 😤🤪🤪
"I just hate how the whole crew excluded min seol ah from everything.   She  isn't in promotion, not in any interviews."
So these people were having fun behind the scenes while we were having crises watching the drama
I'm so addicted to these behind the scenes video
Hi can anyone tell me if there is a behind the scene of the part where Seol A is getting bullied by all the Hera kids in the van after they found out her real identity?
seokhoon😍
They love each other so much offscreen❤️
"I'm amazed by their talent! Like look at their acting, soooooooo amazing istg ajyxhwjuxbwihx"
I was scared for a second when seo jin wanted to share the candy 😂😂 but anyways watch them on runningman!!!😚
Ji hee and taevin is so perfect as a drama couple..
I need to see behind the scene of this kdrama so that I'll not hate them for real😌😌
Seok Hoon at the end of the vid makes me want to smile too 🙈😂
the penthouse cast is so sweet irl !
Indeed Ji hyun(seok kyung) was the one who always lift up the mood!!!😚✨
i can't hate them in real life 😭
I love how min seol ah act its so wonderful

In the series vs reality. I hated everyone who was mean and bully Rona but the actors are so cute😂  I wasn't confused. To who was the main character but I googled it. I actually thought Rona was the main character though
"Choi ye bin, pretty much scares me with her acting facial expressions, yet its so so good! 👌🏻"
i like seok hoon most he is so adorable
i watch this to lessen the stress in this drama hahahh
Seok hoon is too cute🥺❤
After seeing The Real Penthouses Drama my Reaction about the Bad Characters😵😤😡 but when I watched the BTS then I'm Like ahh☺️😄 No need to Frustrated Any more😂
Young dae is so cute
Huh im so upset with eunbyeol😩
"I cant believe that both taevin (min hyuk) and jun seop (one fine week) was in myteen, i didnt know that group exist before pdx101 TT"
When you are here to remind yourself that they are actors playing the roles😂😂😂
Han Ji-hyun 🥰🥰🥰🥰
The bully indeed got the best acting..... I hate them so much in the drama and that proves the acting is just amazing
How kind seo jin in real life!!😍

Waahh kalian membuat drama ini penuh canda tawaa aku nonton dirumah sakit kepala. Hahhahahahah
di drama kea nya bikin kejang2 bgt ya
"I'm really amazed by their actings, but why did you guys have to take it that far. I mean, the High School Students, how the hell do you guys manage to do such a thing, I'm trying not to be angry but I just hope that something like this doesn't exist whatsoever. The fact that it is making me angry and that I really want to teach those high school students a lesson and I know this is all part of acting but it just not it. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy watching it too, but when it gets too serious, I'm sorry but I can't help it."
the fact that they rehearse lines at the penthouse lol
My mindset was disrupted after watching this bts. Waaah
need more kim hyunsoo's bts..
Not me watching bts to remind myself its just a drama and that there is no need to kill anyone😂😂
Thankyou for subbing
0:19 Rona looked so smol
1:05 logan lee you're so cool for me.
Can we just agree that every song on the playlist deserves a grammys?...
"Kim Taehyung, beautiful and goob boy!!"
"""Black Swan"" is the song that gives me goosebumps. ""Life goes on"" is the song that just melts my heart. ""Dynamite"" is the song that makes me wanna dance.  Edited:  Thanks for the likes ARMY!!"

Junkook it's  out the world   My love oh MY good 😢
Taetae's voice is heaven.  The idol of the idols.

Hermoso
The pitch in their greet gets higher as it gets younger lol
"For those in the comments saying Enhypen are not Big Hit artists, Enhypen is half managed by Big Hit Entertainment. Belift is a joint venture company. But with the case of groups like Seventeen, their company called Pledis is a Big Hit Labels acquisition and is not under Big Hit Entertainment! So please don’t get mad about that and dismiss Enhypen thinking they aren’t in the Big Hit Entertainment family!! They very much are ❤️"
BTS - all members wear black coat   and Namjoon wear skin coat  Namjoon-  what???
"OMG I didn't know that there's still some fans who doesn't know the difference between big hit LABELS & big hit ENTERTAINMENT knowing the meaning of 'acquisition' and 'joint venture'   Big Hit LABELS  - Big Hit Entertainment: BTS, TXT, Lee Hyun - Belift Lab: Enhypen - Source Music: Gfriend - Pledis Ent: SVT, Nu’est...  hope this helps for those who's still confuse out there, lovelots! <3"
My three fav boy bands. I love them so much. My lovely boys
I feel like they just gettin cuter and cuter

"If Kim So Yeon doesn't get any BEST ACTRESS award then the Industry was a lie. Such a strong, impressive and versatile actress."
Wow i didn't know she can play piano cause when she's in we got married all.she can do is bowling waahhh such a talented goddess
"Wow, she’s amazing! She’s can be truly evil and plays the piano? I really did thought it was a double or something. So, I wonder if the teenagers really knows how to sing than? It would be great if they do. It makes this drama superb. I like how the older adoptive bro said in the interview ep that all supporters did so well that they’re actually lead and lead roles can be supporters roles, something like that, everyone is so great that the main character changes a lot and it makes u guessing. Even the main girl seems like she’s a supporter role at first and eguene n villain were main."
wow I've always wondered how they make the rain fall in the scenes
If actress playing chong so jin didn't got a daesang this year for best acting then the award show is rigged
The penthouse is the best drama I have ever watched...
"Kim So Hyeon was one of the best actresses I've seen in kdrama. Just look at her personality in real life, she's cute and bubbly and innocent, it's the complete opposite of Cheon Seo Jin. You'll never see, not a hint of Kim So Hyeon once she started to take on the role of the evil Cheon Seo Jin. 👏👏👏"
FACT: Kim So Yeon and Eugene’s husbands in real life are doppelgängers.
Wow this drama has such amazingly talented actors.Yhats what makes this drama an A+!!!
"When your real personality is so pure and  kind hearted and your role is this kind of villain, that means you are really a great  Actress 👏 kudos to Kim So Yeon Unnie for portraying your role very well like wow!!! I've watched all your dramas and you're always been amazing but this role in Penthouse is another level, like you exceeded wahhh 🙌👌👏  I Love you even more"
"Her acting is so good, she can portray the emotions of the character so well with her expressions!! I'm extremely impressed of how meticulous and professional she is, she definately has an applaudable talent for acting"
Soyeon deserve an award for her acting skill
"I have no idea what this show is about, but damn her acting is incredible! I literally got chills! I never got chills before.. she deserves any award honestly!"
That the piano scene and the hospital scene gives me fricking goosebumps!!  I am so looking forward to more Seojin iconic scenes
Wowwww...that teacher knew how to sing opera and she knows how to play piano....waaaah❤️
Kim so yeon acting skills is so adorable I like her so much huhu I hope He wins the award of best actress
"Kim So Yeon unnie has good personality, totally amazing"
"Feel bad for Kim So Yeon's voice after all the screaming, but damn does she do it well."
More penthouse behind the scenes with eng subs pleaseeeee
Gosh incredible but the song was different....in the drama it was mazeppa by franz liszt....but even the bts was really incredible....
"1:00 ""why is the photo so hilarious"" lmao kyu jin wjy are u like that HAHSHHSHAA"
omg Cheon Seo Jin is super sweet behind the camera. she is such a great actress
she's amazingggg~~
i think seo jin act in s2 is little bet taky
I thought i will be waiting for the min seol a bullying part 👁👄👁
They're amazing...
she is so talented!❤
This is one of the best kdrama i ever seen😊😊😊
I addict the penthouse drama because of all actors and actress
What an amazing actress!!
This actresses and actors are just superbly amazing.
"na.to/snaphotsauxr                Ma il nuovo modello organizzativo ci impone di analizzare il ritiro delle attivita correnti. Tenendo conto degli indicatori di successo, diluiti con una discreta dose di empatia, il pensiero razionale richiede la definizione e l'affinamento di un sistema di formazione del personale che risponda ai bisogni urgenti.Il significato di questi problemi e cosi evidente che l'analisi semantica delle opposizioni esterne e uno stadio qualitativamente nuovo nella fattibilita economica delle decisioni prese. L'alto livello di coinvolgimento dei rappresentanti del pubblico di riferimento e una chiara dimostrazione di un semplice fatto: la solidarieta di un team di professionisti e perfetta per attuare forme di influenza.🔥  一方、開発の基本的なベクトルは、社会によって設定されたタスクの定義と明確化を必要とします。紳士、今日の経済アジェンダ、そしていつものことを新たに見直すことは、間違いなく進歩的な発展の方向性のための新しい視野を開きます。"
Makin Deket nih yeee
The acting and the plot in the penthouse is son good i actually get so mad to the point where i stop watching the series for like months
My favorite drama and favorite people
6:52
"When she plays the piano,her face like joker in women version...isn't it"
Anyone know the piece she's playing please tell me that is so beautiful❤❤❤❤✨✨😍😍 please
Seo Jin is my wife
6:52 what is the name of the song she is playing?
I LOVE THE PENT HOUSE 😘❤💕💖
"I am the 1,oooth like teehee :)"
"When Kim so yeon acting angry while crying and shaking made me amazed, she has awesome emotions acts. Every scenes of her very astonished me!"
How did they do the grandpa falling down the stairs

"just remember that these are “ideal” types, people can find love with whoever despite them being the polar opposite to their ideal type <3"
When you're exactly 7 years younger than him 🥂
"I'm 10 years younger than him 😭😭 Those who are 13 years old may come with me, we'll cry together 😭😭"
So basically Jungkook wants an older sister- 💀
"""so girls let's take care of our hair "" 😭😂"
as taehyung said: get out of your imagination now this place is not good
"girls who are too young for him, let’s cry here together 😭😭"
So basically jungkook never wants to get married?
45 to 48Kg's?!  For a grown woman?!  She'd have to be skin and bones!   I wish men didn't have these unrealistic expectations for women.  It just perpetuates eating disorders.  But yet they want someone who's healthy.
I Think I should get out Cause I Am not his ideal type bye bye Good luck for u all😂
"as soon as he said  ""pale skin"" ""straight hair"" even though I knew I had no chance this made me KNOW I have no chance at all. cries in brown/tanned skin and curly hair."
when age doesn't amtter  me: LETS WAIT TILL IM 18!
I thought I was a bit younger than Jungkook but ya’ll in the comments are like 12-14 years old wtf 😂😂 I feel like the unnie here coz he’s only 4 years older than me but 10 years older wow you guys are baby armys haha
"I’m sorry, but if you really think you can get with BTS members, It’s not possible. Please respect these celebrities as artists who want to make you feel happy with their music and videos, don’t crave for a relationship you know will most definitely not happen. Most of the people here are young girls, 9-15, I’m here to tell you to put aside the false dreams and hopes because these idols will most likely end up with someone their age within Korea. Don’t worry though, you don’t need to be in all of these expectations to be considered beautiful, the right guy for you will come one day, he will be too good you will forget about wanting Jungkook. Love yourself as always and take care💞✨"
when it said he likes younger girls but not younger than 7 years......i lost it
I don't believe in ideal types because when you truly love someone you stop yourself from loving even if they don't fit your ideal type. Also Jungkook said nothing about age.
"I'm average, 158 cms, cannot speak Korean, don't like to play games except candy crush, wavy hair, don't know if I can stay in Korea, these are the things that don't match......Then why am I watching this????😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 Anyway I like him as a singer....😍😍😍"
Jhope  is  ok  with long distance relationship ;) 🥰
"i feel so uncomfortable when i watch these videos but my curiosity got the best of me. Also, I really don't want to upset anyone, but this can be extremely toxic. Please be realistic and consider the fact that this guy is probably going to date a Korean woman, either non army or another idol who belongs to his world and will understand his struggles. If we really want the best for them, then we need to let them love, even if it is not ""us""."
Whoever is 8-9-10 years younger than kookie don't worry coz age don't matter
"The Honest fact is, When You and I are not Jealous(Never-ever) or not even sad at JK's Ideal type of Girlfriend or wife Because I know Kookie deserves Someone MUCH Better than me,,, Besides,I love myself for what I am cause they have taught us to Love Yourself💜 And I'mma Happy-Go-Lucky Fangirl Afterall😇😇"
Now please you guys don't start to change yourself....look everyone has an ideal type....but when a person fall in love he doesn't see weather he/she is her/his ideal type or not he/she just fall in love....so if you don't match with someone's ideal type just relax guys....the person who will truly love you will love you for your own personality ❤️💜💜
Wtf *45-48 kgs* Reducing your weight to that much is also injurious to health. If your height is say 164 cms and weight is 45 that's undeweight and cause health problems.  Please know that you don't have to change for anyone else. Keep in mind that jk always loves us army's💜
Snap back into reality guys 😂
i am literally 12 years younger... anyway i am really in love with him so I could do anything for him EDIT:  Its the first time i got more than  2 likes!!!!!!! tho i am planning to be a kpop idol''' now..
*jungkook likes smart girls* Me: *cries in stupidity*
It’s the way that male voice says Jungkook for me. “Yungkuk”.
I like Jungkook and all but I’m going to Felix from stray kids now.
Those 54 dislikes are from DELULU shippers who keeps assuming that he's not straight and will get married to some of their other idol oppas or another BTS member.😭😭 Sad
How is he expecting to find a non famous gf if there are always swarms of people around him🤣😭
"So ARMY,let's take care our hair💜"
Kookie wants to marry at 100 years old. ☠️🤣
When u r his ideal type girl but the age difference always made u cry 🙂🙂I'm not crying 😭😭
I'm sorry I can't wait till he is 100yrs old wish you all the very best
Me crackling all along because the voice is so funny 😭😭
Lets All Just support Who he choose to spend his life with💜    Cuz lets just be real here each of us has an average of 0.0000000000000000000000000001% to even get close to him
I am 7 yrs younger than him... But babe u can't have me... Or should I say I can't have you. Ahahaha reality sucks🌚🌝
So basically IU still fits in his ideal type . Yas Kooku ❤️
''Ideal weight'' when your height is 1m55 but your weight is 43kg we have a big problem here-
5:25 definately our leader namjoon
I'm not his ideal type 😭💔🙂 Well I can sing like him😔that's it😔 I hope other armys can take care of him 💖💜😇
I just think he will find someone who will love her not just hes 8-10 year's younger than him or older I mean if it's truly love then just let them to love . Anyways I will support him even if that girl is not that pretty not that good just if he loves her then we also need to love her . Dont change yourself just because an idol GOD has love for everyone at the perfect time so just let it be.
me crying in the corner because I'm way small I'm literally 4'11 at the age of 18 I wish I was TALL!😭😭😭
Idk why but I feel kinda guilty watching this😭😭😭😭
When kpop idols say they date their fandom or a normal girl that support there group but always end up with another kpop idol
I read as 'Jungkook is ideal type of girls' and thought this is gonna be thread of hot JK 👁👄👁
When you’re 12/13 years younger than him...
"Straight hair:Sorry but my hair is kinda of a hair which sometimes becomes straight,curly and rolling,so my hair is just a ✨Chaos✨ Pretty hands:My hands was stabbed with a pen by a unnie when I was a baby and there is a small brown spot so let's just yeet that I forgot-2000:✨Bye bye✨🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️"
3:24 because he's scared that Jimin will be taller than him so his noona cant be taller than jimin lol
Lmao I can’t imagine Jungkook bringing a weighing scale and a stadiometer 💀💀💀
I'm 14 he's 23/24 it's okay tho he's still my idol let me go watch tae now
It's like a once in a blue moon to meet kookie. So love is no where in the air.  I pray kookie and his future wife live a long life with lots of love and happiness. May god bless them with cute kids.  I do like kookie but I'm not his ideal type. • We have a age gap of 5 years • Recently I'm having hair problems • I'm 02 liner • I've curly hair • I rarely wear makeup • I'm not into video games  N E V E R M I N D !  I pray that Jungkook's future wife take care of his heart. May people loves Kookie but she will be the lucky one to capture his heart.  ~ Army 💜
"When you are perfectly his ideal type and the word ""NOONA"" hits you like train."
I'mma start learning Korean now-
There are so many description but all i can think of is IU. Because of what he admit in so many interviews and shows. He just gives other girls some hope but i think he is very loyal to IU. Until now he likes to sing and promote her songs.. And always look like a proud bf in every award shows. He likes to have a collab with her but we still don't know if its going to happen because some fans might be jealous.. Let's just wish them happiness because they deserve too be happy too.
When we say we're he's ideal type but 9 years younger than him😭😭
OMG my heartu break into million of pieces 💔💔💔 then jungkook will don't date me bcz I'm 14 and he is 23 he and I are 8 years apart 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
he lost me at weight 👁👄👁  BOI I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO WEIGH THAT LITTLE I-
the way this robot dude is pronouncing kookie is sending me
5:39 R.I.P SHIPPERS 😂😂😂
the way I don’t fit his type in 345678902 diff ways LMAO okay but the coral lipstick thing who cares what colour it is 😭
"SO HERE'S THE THING, OUR 8TH BTS ANNIVERSARY GOAL IS TO MAKE '""NO MORE DREAM'"" HIT IB.  I KNOW IT SOUNDS DIFFICULT BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT. BTS ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THEIR DEBT WAS NOT A BOP AND DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK BACK AT IT.  IF WE ARE ARMYS, HIT IT TO 1B, THEY WILL REALISE THAT THEY WERE KINGS BEFORE AND  NOW TOO.."
"This is hilarious, like, sorry girls, jungkooks ideal type is jimin"
"ARMYs, I guess we are lucky😄, cause Jungkookie loves to date an ARMY like us💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
I cannot believe my hobby traits match with him perfectly
Me being happy for being 16-Yayyy!👍😉!! Then me-But wait he is not going to marry me 😕I am frustrated oh sorry trustfated
"FUN FACT: I matched all the preferences expect for weight, Video games and speaking fluently in Korean Lol😂😂😂"
Jungkook you want so many things. I'm leaving from the line.
Noona must be IU his ideal girl.
I didn't matched any for Taehyung but here you go Jk😀😀
*Cries with curlyhair
"I'm only 2 years younger than him, just dreaming he'll marry me😆😆😆😆I think he had never seen a girl wearing saree with untie long hair😍Btw most probably Jhope said that, language is not a barrier if there is love....😍 and I agree with him❤️"
When he said his Future Girlfriend has to like kids = I’m out🚪 🏃‍♀️ sorry but don’t like kids that much 🤣🤣😂🤔 I even can’t look barely after myself
Love you baby jungkook...stay healthy and happy
"WTH, 😭😭😭😭 I'm watching jungkook ideal type videos right on the day before my exams and I'm getting Byju's learning app ad in between and it's kinda freaking me out🤧"
"Well  I'm 12 years old and I can't speak Korean fluently and I have boy cut, i mean hairstyle 😅 don't worry guys our right partner will come a day and don't be afraid to show really who you are 😉 😊 💜"
One thing I want to tell when he'll fall In love he will not see any perfection
I only get 70% of his ideal type whHhYyyy~... It's fine I already passed taehyung's ideal type aheahe omo.
"likes ""sun tanned skin "" .. he wants it i got it   likes ""straight long hair"" .. he wants it i got it  likes ""girls upto 174cm"" .... he likes it i got it"" wants ""girl's weight 45 to 48"" ... me realizing the last time i was 48 was in grade 8th  *crying n sobbing in a corner in pain* T-T   T-T   T-T"
"Watching I’m freaking out, I’m 6 years younger, i have tanned skin, my favorite color is white and I got a lot of white clothes, I love overwatch I even have a D.va gun my hair is medium but I’ma keep it long and my hair is straight. AAAAH"
That noona word got me rolling !! 😂😂
8 years younger than him 💕
When you are trying yourself to be fit in his ideal type and find out HE WANTS TO GET MARRIED AT THE AGE OF 100 👀 👀 👀 👀 👀
"Im 12 years old younger than jungkook,means lm 12 years old ,but still love him like a bias ,coz there is no age for love #ARMY forever 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 l love you BTS"
Is it IU again 😂😂
Kookie always stare at his own hand and he also wants his future girlfriend would also have pretty hands✨
Hobi is ok with long distance and with foreigners ;) 😍🥰
Damn I had hope but I’m too young!! I just had to be born in 2006 didn’t I 🤦‍♀️🥴😭
I just lack of speaking korean but the rest checked✅
When you are exactly like his ideal type but then age gape makes you cry 😞😖😢😫😭😭
"I'm dying every time he say ""kookie""😍😍💜💜"
I pretty much match him just I can’t speak Korean but I would learn
"I know he said 7 years younger but let's be realistic girls! Kookie would never date a minor, he only said it to make the younger ARMY happy. He also said ideal is between 2000-1992 so that means between 20-28 years (he said that last year). So no - if you're 16 you'd probably not date him 😂 and everyone under 16 don't even start dreaming! It is illegal in Korea & I don' think you'd want to put him into jail 😅"
"When you are his ideal type,and he is yours not because he is famous,but two thing rushes it all😣"
2:32 I like that😍💋 💝💖❤️
"I like your video, but I'm sad for myself because I'm 8 years younger than them 😂😂😂"
You can feel the pain when you are 11 yrs younger than him🙂😭
Can someone PLEASEE tell me where he told about the 7 years age gap!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💜💜
I love jeonjungkook... I love jeonjungkook  I love jeonjungkook  I love jeonjungkook  I love you jeonjungkook.  U are my first and last lover....☺ Stay happily forever 😍😘😘😭😔

*True fact: Everyone who listen to this song is getting healed.*
I'm so proud of BTS that they raised their voice against asian hate. Only an asian can relate to this situation.
"""When this song ends, may you be a little happier""  Me: Crying and smiling at the same time"
"i’m not crying, you are."

"""When this song ends, may you be a little happier"" NO IM JUST FCKN CRYING BTS WHAT DID YOU DO WITH ME HUH"
Imagine how the animators took for this animation
TinyTan World Domination!!
"Wey,que hermoso me hizo llorar mucho🤧💜✨  ⠀⠀◣ ◢ ⠀⠀█ █ ⠀⠀█ █ ⠀⠀◤ ◥ 💜BTS💜"
"Yo: teniendo un montón de problemas en mi vida. BTS: está bien, sé que puedes lograrlo, te prometo que lo harás mejor.  Chao, no dejo de llorar, me hacen feliz."
~cries hysterically~ & floods house with tears
*Sitting in a corner and crying at how cute they are*😭
I always wonderd why BTS have so many fans and are the most famous group.... Now i know why ❤️❤️
At 1:26 jin's voice feels like heaven
"""When this song ends, may you be a little happier""  Me struggling to read that phrase because of my tears"
emotional twerking.
"BTS: _when the song ends, may you be_ _happier_  Me: *crying a river*"
Why am I cryingㅠㅠ it's just an animation
"Y pensar que estos 7 chicos pasaron de ver juegos artificiales fuera de un estadio, a verlos en su propio concierto frente a muchísimas@RM¥$!! me da gusto ver todo lo que han logrado con el paso de los años"

They weren't lying when they said they want to make comforting songs
"I'm late but Tell Me You're not Crying while watching This, bc i did 😭"
2:23 LOOK AT YOONGI- HE'S SO CUTE WTHH🥺🥺
The moment yoongi was leaving with that smile..i really screamed 'DON'T LEAVE' loudly with a crying face ...   The last part hurts very much ...this tinytan version is like Army journey..7 angels enters in this soulless life and gives u the most happiness nd then leaves ...i can't imagine the world flood in 2027..:'(
Suga is so cute

Crying and smiling at the same time 💜
"them: ""When this song ends, may you be a little happier."" me: *bawling rivers of water out*"
I don't know why other people bashing BTS. There song is so helpful to the people who are suffering from depression or anxiety. BTS' music deserved to be on top because they spread positive vibes.
*When the song ends you maybe little happier* Me crying the whole ocean 😭
Why is this so comforting when you know the meaning of it
"Bold of them to think i'll be happier after this song ends, zero o clock is my crying song 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲"
2:22 pls notice jin in the side of your screen he cutee🥰🥺🤗💜
La escucho cuando estoy triste :(🥺sin duda BTS llegó cuando mi mundo se callo
Army porque tan pocas visitas a esta hermosa canción?? video hermoso que estoy segura que los chicos vieron cada detalle para que nos sintamos mejor al escucharla y ver el video!! A darle más amor!!

Esta canción siempre la veo por que me hace sentir feliz y de que mañana pueda intentar de nuevo hacer realidad mi sueño 💜
BTS really can do this magic🎊🎊
"Dear parents, just because your Child is smiling at their phone dosen't mean they have boyfriend or Girlfriend, they are just looking at BTS"
Eles ficou tão lindos desse jeito rsrsrs 😍😚 Ameiiiiiiiiiii 💜❤
Mình chưa thể nói với các cậu ấy rằng mình đang rất hạnh phúc được ! Nhưng sau khi bài hát này kết thúc mình đã  hạnh phúc hơn một chút ! Chí ít cũng không quá buồn nữa ! Hi vọng mọi chuyện tốt đẹp rồi sẽ tới ! Yêu Bangtan của tớ
'WHEN THIS SONG ENDS MAY YOU BE A LITTLE A HAPPIER' fck what did u do seven to me?😭💜

"“You didn’t find bts too late, you found them when you needed comfort”"
"Sinceramente no pensé que iba a terminar llorando T-T Amé, amo y amaré a BTS"
my biggest dream    to hug bts in heaven
all members vocal are so on point here. didn't know that bts could make this kind of song like this
"Whenever I would feel sad, when I feel like everyone around me keeps on moving and I'm the only one that's stuck, I listen to this song. I cry but I would instantly feel better. 💜"
HOW MANY INTERNATIONAL ARMYS FANS ARE HERE??  👇👇💜💜

Cry cry cry is all I can do in this moment laying down in my bed in the dark
1:17 imagine waking up to see this
"At the end of the day, BTS have ARMY and we have them, nothing will stop us from being together and taking on the world. Our bond is stronger than anything, and there's no way we'd ever leave the other behind for BTS are nothing without ARMY and ARMY are nothing without BTS 💜"

Can we talk bout how freaking gorgeous is taehyung looking in this video like i-
“What happens if BTS is given a camera”  4M peoples: *Interesting*
All the time I was only staring at Taehyung's tattoo.
I'M SORRY BUT MY EYES ARE ON TAEHYUNG'S EXPOSED CHEST-
bts: what's your favorite lyrics on ON? taehyung: OH NA NA NA
Normal people seeing a camera: 📸  BTS seeing a camera: 🪖🔫🧨💣
Bighit: This is a camer-  BTS: gun.

Someone tell Taehyung to cover up his chest..lol.. I'm dying already
"ok kim taehyung is already hot , but im telling u he like 1000x hotter with those tattoo's"
Title: what happens when bts given a camera    My mind: RM breaks it!
"I’ll forever be grateful to ON era, for all those outfits and looks !!"
Big hit: here this a camera   Taejinkook: no it's a gun brrrrrr
🇮  🇱 🇴 🇻 🇪 🇾 🇴 🇺  🇹 🇦 🇪 🇭 🇺 🇳 🇬
Did anyone noticed jimin's phone cute him showing his little hand
Funfact: everyone is staring at Taehyung's tattoo
Who wished to be the camera? hahaha
"Jin, Taehyung,JK=How me trying to take LOTS of photos of BTS  Jimin=me tryna take selfie in midst of hyper friends lmao"
"Me watching- *""Heart races realllyyy fast""* Taehyung exposing his chest😍😍💜"

“What happens when bts is given a camera” Like BigHit is starting to experiment 😂
Imaginen lo afortunada o afortunado que debió ser la persona que le pinto todas las marcas en el pecho a V?? No cabe duda que dios tiene favoritos
"I loved Taehyung's style and they saw those tattoos on his chest, I couldn't stop looking at him. V is really handsome and no one can deny it."
Armyguinhas vamos fazer macumba para a gente se tornar essa câmera que os meninos estavam segurando kakkakaa
Jimin jugando con el celular de hobi que lindo ...i love BTS 💜
"Ah, I love them"
V😍
My focus to video content is lost because of Taehyung's exposed chest and tattoo.
Me seeing jimin taking a picture:😁😏 My mind: jimin post that🥺
Teajinkkook: camera gun brrr brrr  Jimin what the heck are you doing are you dreaming  Teajinkook: .....dont look at me i dont know what I'm doing..?
BTS really saved my life! Thank you Army for always Supporting the boys!!
"jimin : **just want to take pictures** jin, v, jk : ye gun go skrt skrt"
Já parou pra pensar o que se passa na cabeça de jimin?
"Every time, tae💜💜 drive me crazy 🤪"
Муд по жизни Чимин:
jimin: *literally just trying to take a selfie* taejinkook: hehe camera gun go brrrr
0:45  Jimin : taking ageyo selfies  Jin : playing with a gun (camera)  Suga : looks like sleeping or something else
Jimin learning how to do the hand senser selfie thingy... 🥺🥺🥺🥺 My whole body exploded with uwus
Taehyung 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
"You always laugh ARMYs to you all thanks. I wish to meet you. Stay tuned and love yourselves just as you please do not sacrifice your body for our sake. We love you as you are. The sweetest group of Seven Kings 👑 With me, my love Hajar"
V : *focusing on camera* ARMY : *focusing on V's exposed chest and tattoos* 👀
All Armys would agree that BTS are always there to make us smile💜
Everyone's playing with camera but cute jimin is busy in taking selfies 😄😍🤗
"While BTS is having fun with the camera, here I am worrying the shutter count of the camera HAHAHA"
Jin's laughter is an instant serotonin booster.
"taejinkook: having fun with the camera jimin: just flexin mah hand  suga: im not here hon, im just a delusion, just a delusion"
كيم تايهونغ ♥️ ♥️♥️♥️♥️ حبيبي المستقبلي تايهونغ.
"Esses meninos, são fofos fazendo seja lá o que for.  Parecem crianças brincando com qualquer coisa que pareça divertida.  Kkkkkkk"

How amazing to see them fascinated by a Camera

Estan de acuerdo que hubo un alguien que estubo mas de 2 horas dibujando en el pecho y cuello de tae?
This is how bangtan find happiness in the simple things
Moral of the story.... never give BTS something that can't be played with
"While they play with camera jimin busy looking how handsome he is..... Actually, all of u guys are cute, handsome and charming... Love u all 💜😘🤩😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘"
Here Taehyung is truly fascinating!😍🥰
Taehyung~a i love you so much when you cry i cry when you laugh i cry again so you never cry my heart hurts.💜💜💜 I'm sorry if I made a mistake😔
Jimin'in telefonun reklamını yapmasına ne demeli peki hahahhahahahahahahaha
Whoever styled V in that outfit and makeup deserves a raise. Period.
Tae is so beautiful❣️
"In MV they look like: Idols that army love. In Reality they look like: Kids that army love. No matter what they look like,I still love them :>"
"KookTaeJin are busy playing with the camera and using it like a machine gun, while Jimin is trying to figure out how to click a picture with his hand out🤣🤣"
BigHit : So do you want to see tae tae with tatoo  . . . . ARMY: YESSSSSS 💜💜💜💜

If I put this book mark on my books then I will keep staring at the Bookmark instead of reading the book 😂😂😂😂
I concentrated on it more than my physics lecture
"My teacher told us to make book marks for an assignment (we just got news book for the semester and she wanted to add some fun to online school) and when I had to show my book mark, so many of my classmates were like ""OMG ARE YOU AN ARMY TOO!!?!??!"" and we have been best friends since lol all thanks to this talented and detailed youtuber."

"I did, and it's beautiful! Good health to your hands! When I did, I said it like Lisa:Oh, WOW! It's so easy! Tomorrow I'm going to do the ARMY one."
"There’s something about BTS eating together that always makes us feel at home. Nothing truly makes me happier than seeing domestic BTS,   Preparing their own food together and then eating and enjoying together. Something about seeing bts eating while reminiscing their happy memories together with the biggest smile on their faces really warms my heart. BTS happily eating together is my favorite concept."
*Not even my biological family sits like this- we dont have a sit down dinner ritual. These men value their principles and tradition. They have been raised well*
Namjoon talking anything that come to his mind when he's drunk he's such a pure soul.
They look like that uncles at family gathering who talked and laughed about the old days when they were young 😂
Seokjin and Yoongi everyday in the Soop: What are we eating today?
_We all know !!_ *JIN X FOOD*  is the real ship😂🤣😂🤣
BTS eating together SCREAMS a perfect family
"A family that sits together , laughs together , eats together.... 💓💛"
I think it's the best eating style in the world 😋 Who agreeing? 👇
Drunk RM is the fanniest RM ever 😂😂
BTS eating together makes me feel comfortable because they talk about theirs old day's a lot 😭
*Them ordering seconds while some of them are already stuffed- and them proceeding to eat it together is the most wholesome  thing ever*
"I'm a 19 year old guy,  and started watching BTS recently... Honestly, they are just ADDICTIVE. Their SUPER CUTE faces, the amazing and unique music videos and powerful dance moves...So ADDICTIVE."
"Jin was busy encouraging v, to flip whatever was in the pan, but our little bunny, be like, please let us eat it."
"Jk said, they are Worthy envying.. Bcoz they are too close, Min Yoongi said."
At 15:00 that's when i realized that Jin is that kind of father that will let his kids make mistake and it's okay.
"It hit me hard when Jin said “ Jjangu, come back to life” he must have missed his bestfriend really bad."
THE ONE THING I CAN SAY FOR SURE IS THAT I FELL LIKE IF YOU EVER GET THE CHANCE TO EAT WITH BTS THEY WOULD DEFINITELY NOT MAKE YOU FEEL LEFT OUT AT ALL...  THEIR GONNA MAKE SURE YOU JOIN THE CONVERSATION!! HAVE SOME LAUGHS AND THEY ARE DEFINITELY GONNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU EAT WELL FRFR!! CLEAN PLATE CLUB  💟💟💟💟😂😂🥺🥺🙈😍😍☺️😄👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾✨💯🍽
Love how they are appreciative of the chef’s efforts and praise him for how delicious the food is. There is no better motivator for a person who has to cook. They really are such a happy family because they can enjoy the fellowship of eating and drinking together with lots of laughter.
This family is the best masterpiece of nature (feeling blessed)
To think they hardly knew each other and look it just melts my heart
"""It doesn't matter if it's bland, Suga made it for us ""                                                                            -Jung Hoseok"
"BTS even when there eating there funny and so sweet,BTS are so talkative when there eating,when I eat I’m just quite!"
Me watching this video: sitting next to the screen with a bowl of microwave ramen pretending that I was also there.  This is sad. *F*
Suga is cooking its so cool 👨‍🍳
They looked like bestie x college students that always spend vacation together...😭😭😭
Domestic bangtan is my favourite they look so soft reminiscing about their past they must have lot of story to tell each other 😭. Looking at each other with fond smile man i wish i have their type of friendship. When yoongi said this all possible because they are close its true its hard to balance your work life and friendship. Especially in their line of work
"They’re such a healthy family. Healthy conversation, healthy music, healthy friendship, healthy music. They’re so amazing💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
I love that BTS members are just as happy to share ramen from one pot at a campsite as to dine together at a fine restaurant on tour.
"lovely to c the video!!!! Jin is the cutest soul!!!!!  opening the food splashed on Jin jhope helping by wiping!!!!!!1 cooool !!!!! Yoongi cooking wow!!!!! getting to know dishes whats Pot lid????  Jap Chae, Jju sam, liked how jimin imitated Jin  while making the song DNA and yoongi by JK cool!!!! liked d gesture of v opening the door...  introducing guests RM thoroughly  laughing enjoyed!!!!! V cooked ooooo tuna mayo rice!!!!! nice compilation of video!!!! it does make us feel at home since they too share what they feel while eating!!!!"
"each time i watch BTS eat i'm like ""i need more ramen in my life"" lol"
Jin and v almost sit side by side everytime
Me ready to get emotional and the first clip you put Namjoon and Jin  Pot lid ....😂😂
*The most beautiful family in the world💜💜💜💜💜💜💜*
This makes me miss the times when we used to eat together with my family and grandparents 😭 there is just something special about eating in the company of the people you love
5:54 everyone : the dog sitting beside suga 🥰 Meanwhile me : heheheh why dog sitting next a cat 😂😂
This just screams that they are a family irrespective of where they come from.
"Those that eat together, stay together 💞💙"
I clicked on this so fast!!! Just to realize it was a notice about the premier....TRUE HEARTBREAK! 😭😂
This reminds me of family dinner at home... There are a lot of us and we really enjoy getting Mom or Dad to tell stories of when they grew up. There is always a lot of laughter as everyone tells about their day...  Meal time holds some of the best memories for me and I love that they are making the same kind of memories! <3
"Hello, I'm a new Korean eating show YouTuber.  I enjoyed watching our country, Bts.❤️❤️❤️"
can we appreciate how Jin manage to talk to drunk BTS members calmly
pinkkoya is back with foodie  vids !!
they eat everything and be grateful for what they're eating makes me cry😭
V 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
4:49 i love how jin never hesitated to feed jungkook first. he really is the most precious hyung <3
"A family that eats together, stays together. This is one of the best complications that conveys what a true family BTS brothers are. Well done!"
Lol jin do not want to pay for mint chocolate.
"3:48 pork belly looking like 💋, omg these crackheads lmao 😂"
"When you have this kind of kids happily eating, as a parent, i would be so content and happy and full 😊😘"
BTS love to talk about old days while eating. They are  family.🥺💜
"Yoongi :my mom used to make cooked rice,eggs and mixed with margarine i love this even now."
"It's so cute when Jin gave the spoon to just woke up Jimin, uggh I love them so much"
*RM 💜Jin 💜 Suga 💜 J hope 💜 Jimin 💜 V 💜 Jungkook 💜*
"Awesome to see this.  In Laotian we have this saying ""The food tastes better when we eat together"""
"I pray that they will never  get separated like:One direction ""🥺🤞"
I'm waiting this is gonna take a long time reee
Drunk Namjoon is me when I got my wisdom tooth taken out lol talking about random stuff and making a big fuss about it
2:06 Jin hyung: My heart is being torn to pieces! ('My ma'um is chijajing' what Jin hyung said in Konglish?  Me: 😂 😂 😂 😂 He is such a comedian! 😂 😂 😂
8:37 namjoon scooping his ice cream peacefully is giving me life.
Yeah honestly them eating and waking up together brings me so much comfort. Thank you for this video 🥰 It’s contributing to my happiness and peace of mind
"drunk rm is the cutest, funniest thing 😭"
"awww, it's my greatest pleasure seeing them together its brings joy to my and tears to my eyes, we can't help but love them, the most adorable souls I've ever met, god bless them always"
When namjoon is Drunk he talks a lot hahahahahha
"Hmmm... Nam Joon-ah makes really good japchae, he's good at slicing meat really thin, and he vacuums. Things are looking up!  As much as I Love ramyeon, I don't think I can eat as much (in one meal!) as they do. Good healthy appetites! Thanks for this post, Pinkkoyaa-ssi!! #aRMyLOVE"
Jimin waking up and holding the spoon is such a mood🤣🤣 hungry yet sleepy
We all know how whipped we are for bts when we are just watching them eating together throughout the entire video while smiling 😊💜
I love it when while they are eating they tell story about their some past moments they had together and stories about their family and pets. It is so sweet.💜
"Can I say one thing here rather than respecting the fact that Jin cooks so lovingly for them when BTS can easily keep a chief with millonare they are , calling him MOM which he doesn't like doesn't seem FAIR to me ."
Seeing them eat always makes me so hungry 🤤 How can they eat so deliciously 🤤🤤
"I loved seeing those clips again, esp the ones from “In The Soop”. 😍Nothing brings people together like food."
Jimin is so well mannered!
This video reminding about a dream... Where I dreamt.... Like i was having dinner with them( all seven members) in a hotel along with my best friend.... But sad thing is my friend sat in between me and jungkook 😭😔in that dream.
Jimin is so cute😍😍😍
Am i the only one who is in love with their mouth sound while eating or I'm weird?
I was more focused on the convos they were having rather than the the fact that they were eating. They have such entertaining topics
"Aw this is such a lovely video. It's so sweet how they all eat together, and how they're all so close and caring towards each other!! I feel so comforted by this. 💜"
"I do believe these guys were running low on fuel when the pandemic hit. Their bodies are very young so they can endure but even they need to let their bodies have a good rest. Mentally, that is where it can get worse. Mental fatigue is so dangerous they can even develope severe depression. But they would not have taken a break on their own since they love what they do. But now they are rested, Suga got a much-needed surgery that due to their busy schedule he could not have had."
"They looks like never thinked that they were on camera , they just do what they want do, and i really love their show"
eat Jin eat BTS I wish all of them to enjoy their food like Jin And stay healthy
when jin feeds them his eyebrows furrow lol. such a cutie ( ˘ ³˘)♥︎
I love the way BTS eat together its like they are brothers already.
"Whenever I see a recipe I like in my recommended, the boys always come to mind. They work so hard all the time and I want to prepare a huge feast for them so they can happily eat without having to work extra to get their meals ready. Watching them eat happily and being excited over the food would be the best ever!"
I love this family ❣️
The entire video is so heartwarming!!!!!!! But my most favourite part is the 6 others cheering for V when he perfectly flipped a pajeon.
"My anxiety , stresses always calms down when I see these videos"
"Suga does a lot of the cooking it looks like lol, he would. And he would seem good at it."
knowing them are the best thing in my whole life ever ! thank you for your existence BTS ;)
"How i wish I stan bts earlier. This is the thing that is missing to the ""boyband"" i am stanning before. I don't how how to explain this but i recently check their vids i guess a week ago because of kim taehyung ( ofcourse you know why i got intrigued) and i started to love them and cry with them whenever i saw something bad on some old vids. I cried when i watched the history of bts how people underestimated their capacity as an artist. At first i thought they are just like other boy group or band ( whatever it is they are the best ) but no, they have the bond and affection to each other. They are like no other how they love their fans is the most perfect thing in the world. Haters gonna hate. MY RESPECT TO BTS💜"
"They are so humble ,BTS ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
i wished this video never ended...i was soo enjoying it..ireally love it when they r eating all together ..that's when they talk and are happy...love u BANGTAN . always be happy. i loved ur video
Yessss soooo excited il you videossss💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜

"""can u look at me cause I'm blue and grey"""
"[Lyrics] Where's my angel? I'm sick and tired of everything Someone come and save myself Cause I can't take it anymore Everywhere I go, everywhere I see Can you look at me and say I'm looking free Every time I cry every time I smile Can you look at me 'cause I'm blue and grey? Every time I cry every time I smile Can you look at me 'cause I'm blue and grey?  I just wanna be happier Baby don't let me go I feel tired in the winter sky Wish I could be stronger..."
the way the strings woBbLe is just so satisfying...
"Please don't skip ads so he could earn from doing this, he makes us feel comfortable through his finger style. Let's make him earn from this. Again. Don't skip ads"
"blue and gray is a song by bts which shows that how a lonely person tries to enjoy their life. sometimes, depression, their own thoughts try to eat them up. and now, escaping the circle of depression doesn’t really feels good as it’s how we got used to it and eventually making the odds to even."
Why is this so aesthetically pleasing 🥺
"""Don't say it’s okay  When it’s not okay  Please don't leave me alone, it hurts too much"""
him: *start playing*  me: *s u b s c r i b e d*
Just randomly found this after having a mental breakdown
"Where is my angel 하루의 끝을 드리운 Someone come and save me, please 지친 하루의 한숨뿐 사람들은 다 행복한가 봐 Can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey 거울에 비친 눈물의 의미는 웃음에 감춰진 나의 색깔 blue and grey 어디서부터 (어디서부터) 잘못됐는지 잘 모르겠어 나 어려서부터 (어려서) 머릿속엔 파란색 물음표 어쩜 그래서 (어쩜 그래서) 치열하게 살았는지 모르지 But 뒤를 돌아보니 여기 우두커니 서니 나를 집어삼켜버리는 저 서슬 퍼런 그림자 여전히도 파란색 물음표는 과연 불안인지 우울인지 어쩜 정말 후회의 동물인지 아니면은 외로움이 낳은 나일지 여전히 모르겠어 서슬 퍼런 블루 잠식되지 않길 바래 찾을 거야 출구 I just wanna be happier 차가운 날 녹여줘 수없이 내민 나의 손 색깔 없는 메아리 Oh this ground feels so heavier I am singing by myself I just wanna be happier 이것도 큰 욕심일까 추운 겨울 거리를 걸을 때 느낀 빨라진 심장의 호흡 소릴 지금도 느끼곤 해 괜찮다고 하지 마 괜찮지 않으니까 제발 혼자 두지 말아 줘 너무 아파 (oh) 늘 걷는 길과 늘 받는 빛 But 오늘은 왠지 낯선 scene 무뎌진 걸까 무너진 걸까 근데 무겁긴 하다 이 쇳덩인 다가오는 회색 코뿔소 초점 없이 난 덩그러니 서있어 나답지 않아 이 순간 그냥 무섭지가 않아 난 확신이란 신 따위 안 믿어 색채 같은 말은 간지러워 넓은 회색지대가 편해 여기 수억 가지 표정의 grey 비가 오면 내 세상 (oh) 이 도시 위로 춤춘다 맑은 날엔 안개를 젖은 날엔 함께 늘 여기 모든 먼지들 위해 축배를 I just wanna be happier 내 손의 온길 느껴줘 따뜻하지가 않아서 네가 더욱 필요해 Oh this ground feels so heavier I am singing by myself 먼 훗날 내가 웃게 되면 말할게 그랬었다고 허공에 떠도는 말을  몰래 주워 담고 나니 이제 새벽잠이 드네 good night"
"""Where's my angel?"" ""i just wanna be happier"""
This made my heart cry and smile at the same time.
Blue & Grey is a sad song and now it's even more sad 😭
"BLUE AND GREY IS A SONG FOR HEALING YOURSELF FROM DARK PLACES IN YOUR  HEART . V COMPOSED THIS SONG BECAUSE EVERYONE SUFFERED THIS IN BTS AND THE LINE ""I JUST WANNABE  HAPPIER "" TELLS THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO SUFFER ANYMORE AND JUST BE HAPPY ! ( MORAL : EVEN IF YOU ARE KNOWN WORLDWIDE DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU ARE HAPPY BUT INSTEAD FELLING DEPRESSED AND LOOSING NEAR ONES )"
Honestly this song describes my life and my feelings. Never thought that there could be a song which can describe me nd my life
Is it just me that feeli like you were in the guitar hole looking and enjoying the calming song and aesthetic view 💜
"госпади это просто рай для ушей, спасибо за такое прекрасное исполнение"
The fact that the sky behind is purple....💜 makes this more beautiful💜✨

Сокджин: давайте построим лабиринт и забронируем гору 👌 обожаю Джина 😂
21:28 Чимин: песни БТС такие хорошие я люблю их всех.  Чимин настоящий Army. 😄
Игра Тэхена про общ транспорт - это выживи или умри
"Боже какие же они шумные . Тот факт , что не смотря на свою популярность, они остаются такими же искренними и просто дорками 😭😭"
Чимин бежит в Пусан со скоростью 10 км/3 минуты и кричит: ПАПА!!!! АХАХАХА
"Чимин: ТИШИНА Джин, Хоби и Гук: МОЖЕТ ТЫ ХОТЕЛ СКАЗАТЬ ""ТОРЖЕСТВЕННО""?  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"Джин: что мы можем сделать? Гукки: вот теперь мы можем сжульничать  а чё правильно говорит, зачем думать,когда рядом Моня сидит😅😅😅"
Им нравиться злить Чимина. 😂
Юнги на Чимина : Я думаю у него сегодня не все дома . Азахахвхвхв почему ты такой
Намджун: расскажи о своей первой любви Техён- улыбается Джин: почему он выглядит как студент Чимин: замолчите Чонгук*. -_-
"Шуга:мы можем сделать это,А не можем,потому что у Намджуна нет водительских прав  Моня: у меня нет мозгов?😨 Шуга:водительских прав  Гукки:мы не можем потерять мозг Намджуна. Он самый умный Почему так смешно😹😹😹"
"Все: обсуждают дальнейшие проекты Хосок: какая вкусная печенька, ммм шоколадная🤣🤣"
Все шумят Чимин: ТишЕее Будь торжестевным  Намджун: что это значит 😑
"Аахах Техёни предложил про общественный транспорт,тогда заставка должна быть на этот эпизод:- Здравствуйте, это программа ""Сдохни или умри""🗿🗿🗿😹😹"
Из за тупых хейтэров Тэхен стал таким серьезным🙁❤️
"все так усиленно обсуждают тему, а Хоби в это время тихонечко ест😹😻"
"Я одна сижу и придумываю идеи, разговариваю с бантанами как дура? 😂"
"Юнги: Чимин сказал мне, что он может пробежать 10 км за 3 минуты. ОН СКАЗАЛ МНЕ.  Чимин: ...?? 🤨 *просто в шоке*"
"-Я думал об этом,потому что Тэхену такое понравится😻😻😻"
Чимин : тишина!я говорю! Будьте торжественны! Все : шумят без умолку . чимин 👊😠 Ревууу

"Хоби: я все записываю Чимка: а для меня ты что написал? Хоби: аксессуары  Джин:а моё? Хоби:давайте дальше Чонгук: ничего, он ничего не написал 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"Чимин: Мы можем поиграть в догонялки прятки Юнги: пря что? Чимин: прятки! Юнги: я думаю у него сегодня не все дома. Ты не выспался, верно?"
Намджун :у меня нет мозгов Юнги :у тебя нет водительский прав Чонгук: мы не можем потерять мозг Намджуна
"Арми, давайте теперь использовать вместо ""тихо"" использовать предложение ""бУдЬ тОрЖесТвенНым!"" как Чимин вхыхых)0)00))?"
6:45 Намджун не смущай Тэхёна.
Чимин: - Мне кажется людям нравится в ран бтс физическая активность. Я думал о физических нагрузках. Мы можем сыграть в догонялки или прятки. Юнги: - Пря... Что? Чимин: - ПРЯТКИ  Юнги: - Мне кажется у него сегодня не все дома. 😂😂😂😂
Джин: я ношу то что мне дают стилисты 😏😏😏
"Согласна с Тэ, одним из моих любимых эпизодов тоже был эпизод с деревней Пораскинуть мозгами и попробовать понять кто же предатель, это правда лучшие эпизоды."
"Намджун:Тэхён, расскажи о своей первой любви. Тэхён в мыслях:""Я тебе в соджу слабительного закину"""
Бооооже тот момент когда Ви показал Гуку свою идею ТААААК МИЛОООООООО:Я ОТДАМ ЕГО ТЕБЕ😭😭😭😭😭😭БОЖЕ Я В ЛУЖИЦУУУУ
Нам Джун про Чимина: он может добежать до Пусана за 2 часа Хоби: Пусаааааннннн!!🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏻‍♂️ Гуки: Пппааааапппааааа!!!🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏻‍♂️ 🤣🤣🤣🤣 просто бомба когда они прикалываются над друг другом 😂😂😂
Хосок : Прези.. ден..тация ? ( презинтация ) Хо : Мы можем сделать прическу режиссеру. Хосок ты такой злой 😂 Намджун : мы не можем играть в догонялки из-за Чонгука 😂
"Я бы хотела чтобы они сделали такой ран бтс , который все мемберы читают комментарий арми, как они стали фанатами Бантанов."
"Каждый раз угарала, когда Чимин топал ножкой 😆💜"
: Юнги и Тэхен у нас нету надежды :В этот момент Хося - Да да  пошёл я🗿
"Намджун: Все мои друзья, которые играли в футбол сломали связки! Юнги: Их можно сломать? Случайно не разорвать?"
"ЮНГИ: У МЕН, ЕСТЬ ИДЕЯ   А ОЙ МЫ НЕ МОЖЕМ СДЕЛАТЬ ЭТО   ПОТОМУ ЧТО НАМДЖУНА НЕТ ВОДИТЕЛЬСКИХ ПРАВ  НАМДЖУН: У МЕНЯ НЕТ МОЗГ??? ЧОНГУК: МЫ НЕ МОЖЕМ ПОТЕРЯТЬ МОЗГ НАМДЖУНА   АХАХАХАХАХХАХАХАХАХА ОРУ"
"*Почему я смотрю это, когда опаздываю на пару* 😂😂"
Джун: У меня нет мозгов?!  Юнги: У тебя нет водительский права.   Бедный Нам Джун.
17:45  Чонгук: Рррррэп~Монстр  Намджун:* танцует от слов Чонгука* Я: че они такие милашки😳😍❤
Шуга: сидит между Чимином и Хосоком Я: Юнмин? Юнсок? Юнминсок?🤨

"Ви всю съёмку грустный сидел, только в конце улыбнулся...."
"Боже, а Тэ не подумал что будет если их в транспорте узнают. Их  разорвут на сувениры..."
"Блин, столько классных идей было, а они остановились на теннисе😂💜"
Эпизод с игрой Мафия это идея Тэхена 😍
Тэхёнчик такой котик :3 хочется его обнять~
"Мне очень понравилась идея Техёна. Где он говорит что хочет ран бтс в людном месте ,например в громадском транспорте и чтобы их не узнали.Это будет круто, я бы хотела посмотреть это"
"""Торжество "" Чимина так мило. 😊"
"Джин, говоря, что теннис менее травмоопасный, видимо уже забыл, как ему прилетело в игре в аэрохоккей)) Жалко, что никто не предложил конкурс мокрых футболок)"
Надеюсь выберут идею Тэ.Выживи или умри))

"Шуга: мы можем сделать это, а нет не можем- потому что у Намджуна нет водительских прав Намджун:у меня нет мозгов? 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Юнги: У Нажджуна нет водительских прав Намджун: у меня не мозгов?😆😂 Чонгук: у Намджуна самый большой мозг🥺😂

"Чимин может добежать до Пусана за 2 часа, быстрее чем поезд😂😂😂😂"
Чимин всю свою презентацию: ТИШИНА! будьте торжественными! Я СЕЙЧАС ГОВОРЮ 🤣
"И Тэхен здесь такой лапочка (✷‿✷) как спокойный ребёночек, который выполняет задание в школе, среди шумных одноклассников (✿^‿^)"
"Шуга к Чимину: Ты сегодня не выспался, верно? Сегодня он... (Тэхен, который знает из-за кого Чимин не выспался *ржет*)) Чимин: Не смейся, Тэхен, не смейся !!! >(  шипперы ЮнМинов, привет"

Why is JHope singing maya hee maya hoo SO SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL????
*was i the only one thinking this would be clips from 2021 xD* (not complaining or shading tho xoxo )
"CORRECTION: 4:08 i meant taehyun, not hueningkai 😭 i’m sorry yall i was sleep deprived asf editing this :(("
"""BTS calls us babies"" *Proceeds to drink Milk*"
Bighit has this speciality to find most talented and crackhead people 😌
Not tae tearing up seeing txt's performance 😭  protecc our soft hearted baby  he's too precious
txt : *we must respect them oky?* bts : *mah babies*
"I have noticed that 5:56 when jin was talking about txt, jin started crying a little from inside😢"
I want txt to call bts hyung. Sunbaenim is too formal
Jin doesn’t want TXT to feel alone like how they did when they were younger
How can two big crackhead groups cannot love each other??😂😂
can you imagine the chaos if btxt ever did a video together 😂😂
They are like brothers tbh
I will scream for the day BTS and TxT do a Run or To Do episode together
1:17 taehyung literally being one of the babies of bts acting like an older brother around yeongyu is so endearing
Jungkook : I'm the youngest in BTS and TxT babies call me 'Hyung'  Yeonjun : I'm the oldest in TxT and BTS call me baby.   Me : Can I lend some cuteness from you guys 😃
"BTS AND TXT , A BIG HAPPY FAMILY !"
I was kinda getting emotional during jin talking how he wanted to be close with txt then in next video yoongi's introvert ass straight up gave a thumbs up to beomgyu😂😂 Why are they so cute💜💜
This is so sweet....like big brothers looking out for little brothers. And little brothers admiring older brothers. 🤗💖
BTS are like TXT's parents
"0:46 Tell me, Army. Jhope is so strict, isn't he? He gave direct feedback for Taehyun performance. But then here comes Suga 'defends' Taehyun with ""The floor's way too slippery."" 😂 I think it's sweet of him. But these BTS sunbaenims care for my boys TXT in different way, as a Moa, I'm really appreciate that ☺️"
"I hope that there will be more casual interaction being shown or maybe a collaboration this year without someone making a controversial fuss about it.. It shouldn't be a problem now if BTS or TXT members want to make a content together since both group had their own identity.. I mean they're a family with the same vision for music, not a rival for each other.."
"your intro is literally the cutest thing ever , also Bts and txt best boys 🥺"
BTS: hi- TXT: *claps*
At 2:59 did I hear it wrong or did he really say jungkook hyung?
JK DOING UPS AND DOWNS IN YOUR INTRO IS THE BEST!!
No one  Jimin : calls text babies 👶 😆 Me : ah so cute 😄
03:04 well if u guys act like that even haters will call u all babies💜
I want BTS and TXT to have a lot of interaction this year. I miss seeing their interaction  😭😭😭
"MOA and ARMY should not be disrespectful to each other or to the groups as BTS & TXT will be disappointed if they knew this.  Both groups have different dynamics but there are times when ARMY who have become MOA are reminded of their similarities at times which is nothing to feel threatened about, just be proud they have each other.  Both groups are talented, humble and at times, you forget they are idols by the way each groups' members interact with each other is very family orientated.  I hope in the future there will be a Run Ep or Big Hit family dinner with both groups and Lee Hyun, as the photo shoot at the beginning of 2020 was very much appreciated."
"Aww... So cute jimin calling them"" babies""... I really love the brotherly relationship between them 💜"
Suga’s lil thumbs up to Beomgyu got me lol I’m soft now
i think they see 7yrs ago themselves in TxT that's why they are so loving and kind towards them and BTS is TxT's rolemodel. I am also an Army and a MoA Fan 🔥Lots of Love to both of the groups.
please don't mention txt and esp soobin i will be saying sOoBin soObin yOu kNow yoU knOw sOoBin for entire day :(
6:36 Awww....Jin 😭😭😭😭
Txt earned a lot fame  Through hard work and support  They'll be famous like bts in future I swear 💜💜💜
TAE hugging beomgyu cuz gyu did his part in boy in luv. Then v getting ready in there performance is so bear warming💜❤️✌🏼
your intro...sometimes i come to the intro just watch it and go back djdvksdjsvdjvsd
BTS looks so built compared to small txt members next to them!  But I know for a fact all of them are bigger then me! 😂💜
Tae really loves Beomgyu ahaha<3
Just the video I needed right now 🤧
"5:31 AWWWWW THE WAY TAE JUMPS UP FOR TXT WHEN HE HEARD THEY WON THE AWARD, HE'S SO PROUD OF THEM"
"6:36 they also have boxed meals  yess bighit will treat their idols same,even bh already big,they can give their new idol expensive meals for long time but no,coz they want to make their idols become a strong group,this time they worked so hard but in the future they will get the result of their worked in past❤️"
the fact that they're calling themselves 'hyung' just shows how close and comfortable they are with one another
"""can you say yes just once?"" Omg this kid 🤣🤣"
even we all know that yoongi also has a soft spot for txt 🥺🤲🏼
The intro is always the best !
Bighit Family 💜✌🏻
their relationship isn't just on cam even in reality they're so close each other
2:48 proof that they are that close with the jeon jeongguk bcs lmao hyuka’s laugh said it all😭🤚🏼
"After listening from BTS that TXT are so busy even to have a proper meal with them  breaks my heart, after being so busy they always interact with Moa in their free times!! omg I'm tearing up, I love them so much."
They are literally all siblings    Totally not crying😭😭😭
"YESS, im such a big moarmy and your editing is chef's kiss, i'd love to see more of these videos 🥺🥺"
"4:07 I think that's Taehyun, not Hueningkai......   Beautiful video tho!"
V really does have a special heart for gyu thoo.♥️♥️♥️
That's sweet but did you guys see this? 7:12 Jimin and V came to TXT holding their awards in their hands. Flex
Hahaha! They are my daily medication 😂🤣
Taehyung looks like a proud dad next to TXT
we all need a run bts ft TXT....don't we???? hehe
Being  a MOARMY makes me cry after this :( <3
"I'd never seen that clip of Taehyung tearing up while watching their performance, damn imagine how proud he must've been"
so bighit Run Bts x To Do when?!??
The way Taehyung got excited when txt won rookie of the year in MMA's  I thought BTS won the rookie of the year😂😂. So cute........😭💖😭💖
Their chemistry is so cute :(((
"Seokjin  wanting to spend time with txt to make them feel better in their tight schedule and call each other are brothers, its just so endearing 🥺"
I NEED MORE PLS😭🥺
Plz😭 I was watching the video and then when taehyung pushed his shirt back an ad came on saying am I pregnant..? Me:👁️👄👁️
I love how yeonjun processes to drink his milk
Jin .... Wants another fam of brothers...... Waowwww.... Such a huge hearted person
*I love their interactions so much.*
i'm so glad txt have a big brother group like bangtan
"I always smile like an idiot whenever txt and bts have interactions together, it's so heart warming especially knowing that bts has been the only group at bighit for a long time :'D"
Hobi giving advice to Taehyun made my heart explode
I love BTS and TXT so to see that they like each other is so cute ❤️❤️
i love themm all omg. They really are great mentors i-❤️
Like i remember is Taehyun no hueningkai who is hug in the family photoshoot😂❤
2:51 hyung ?🥺🥺 Mmmmmm kiyowoooo 😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Seokjin cried nooo im sad
One particular moment I went uwu about their bond is when Jin lend Soobin his bday hat since his bday is right after Jinnie and when Jin bought them pizza and wanted to eat together with them but couldn't due to his busy schedule 😭
We need more interaction pls
So cute BTS and TXT together

"Kim Namjoon  You were the one who led BTS to where they are now. You work so hard for them, writing lyrics, supporting them, and loving them. Namjoon, you inspire me to be a better leader.   Kim Seokjin  I have always admired your self-confidence, and your willingness to love yourself. You are also mature, and often silly at times. Seokjin, you inspire me to love myself more.   Min Yoongi  Yoongi, you are always so calm, and quiet. You also show determination to finish anything you are doing. Yoongi, you inspire me to be calmer and more focused.   Jung Hoseok  Hoseok, our sunshine, and our everything. You always are in such a good mood every day, even if your day went bad. Hoseok, you inspire me to smile often.   Park Jimin  Jimin, my angel, and my everything, you were the one who brought me into this beautiful fandom, and you led me out of depression. You continue to help others, even if they anger you. You don’t need abs to be perfect. Jimin, you inspire me to love others   Kim Taehyung  Our Gucci and goofy boy, you used to be a poor boy, but with you hardworking skills, you have the riches, but yet you still didn’t let fame ruin you. Taehyung, you inspire me to be determined   Jeon Jungkook  You work really hard each day, as the maknae, you get teased, but you still don’t let it stop you. You working hard makes me want to stand up and do something too. Jungkook, you inspire me to work harder.   A.R.M.Y  You all comfort BTS as much as you can. I would like to thank you all for supporting them on their journey. Army’s, you inspire me to love BTS more. I will never forget the time when I have joined this fandom, thank you all for such a wonderful experience."

V was so cute when he holding his laughing
This is not comment section this Kim Taehyung yoonminkook section-
I think JK n v are forced to pretend to be distanced. I watch all their Vlive shows in 2020 I don't feel any awkwardness. BH pls explain..
"Jin: it's live everyone, we are live  Members: really?  Rm, the LEADER: is it really live?   Tae: make sure ur zipped up  Bts: *literally checks to make sure their pants are zipped up on LIVE tv* 😂"
Do not laugh challenge? I lost it by seeing the thumbnail only- 😂😂
"aaarrhhh...i almost make it but that Jungkook laughter during bodyfriend cf with Jimin, Jin and Rm fails me..his laughter is contagious..and jin laughter omg...i laughed until the end and gladly fails..."
Fun Fact: Every time Jin forgot to zipped his pant🤣
The fact that we all get here just to laugh 🤣
"Ha ha my baby JUNGOOKAAA so cute, I missing you my cat. I LOVE YOU MY ANGELS💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 FİGHTİNG."
In 2020 sbs live when bts is wishing happy new year namjoon is looking like caramel in chocolate
"The fact that we are watching this to laugh, and not as a challenge😂"
namjin in their own world
7:09 Yoongi looking completely zoned out behind Taehyung 😂

"Those peoples who are in back must be like  ""Is it the world popular BTS? """
8:49 Bighit editors did an amazing job in including all the chaos instead of picking 1 for the opening😂💜☺️
"attention army so here's the thing, our 8th BTS anniversary goal is to make ""no more dream"" hit 1B . I know it sounds difficult but we have to do it. BTS always thought that their debit was not a good and didn't want to look back at it. If we armies , hit it to 1B , they will realise that they were kings before and now too. Let's make their debit mv 1B let's do it armies. I know we can. Share this as much as you can on every platform and in other languages too"
v laugh was so adorable when he say oh baby
Fun fact : We all know we lose this challenge 😂😂  But still seeing the funniest of the members am I right ??
When jk said suga laughing was soooo cute

"*ATTENTION ARMYs* This is very important. I'm not sure myself how much truth there is in it, but still we have to be alerted. As we all know our hobi's birthday is coming soon, if you dont know when it on 18th February. Haters are planning on sending him *THOUSANDS* of death threats which will probably consist suicidal pressure. So ARMYs pleasee pleasee, FIGHT THEM BACK, TRY AS HARD AS YOU CAN. THIS IS SERIOUSLY NOT THE TIME TO STAY SILENT. And this is also not the first time hobi receive's death threats. And please dont forget to send hobi lots of lovely birthday wishes so that you make him feel loved. So ARMY please dont let this happen he's our hope and our sunshine we can't let the haters attack him. Copy paste this and spread the message far and wide. Dont hesitate, post this everywhere because everyone needs to see this whether they're ARMY or not.   I hope you understand the intensity of this situation, and please do all that is in your control.   FIGHTING!!!!!!!!"

0:26 the kids who are holding Jimin's hand never thought he could be a famous person
"I feel like you V Didn't change at all, because from the age 0 you could see Taehyung's draw line and and you can easily tell that It's him even without the name, I think Taehyung's face is unique from the start that he's face Didn't change at all."
JK at 7 yrs old is cute💜
"for me, Jimin when he was younger, he remembered him as he is now. does anyone else agree?"

"Jimin, Tae, and Kookie are beautiful on stage and off stage. They are beautiful inside and out. They are angels, but they are also human. People need to understand this and respect their, and the rest of BTS's privacy. We ARMY's may love them, but we don't know them and they don't know us, so we do NOT have the right to invade their space and privacy. Because in reality, they are human just like us.  💜"
Jungkook looks just like a regular normal boy who knew that one day he’ll grow up to be a golden maknae .. so talented in many different fields

How many did you get right? (Be Honest!)
yuqi confidently singing the wrong lyrics for every single song
Soyeon: answers peacefully   Minnie & Yuqi: KWHSISBSKHWISJSKAJBALAKSBSPAJKAIZHS
"gidle: soojin listens to music a lot, so she could be really good at this  soojin throughout the video: 👁️👄👁️"
No one:  Literally no one: Staff: Taylor Swift- Bad Blood Yuqi: *bAt BuTt?*
Nobody:  Literally nobody:  Soyeon: Dynamite was number 1 on Billboard guys cmon everyone knows this song
"Neverland: The ""G"" is silent! It's just pronounced ""I-DLE""  (G)I-DLE: ""Hi guys, we are GEE I-DLE!"""
Yuqi: I’m good at lyrics! Also Yuqi: *sings in gibberish*
soyeon on stage: 😤🤬😑😡👿 soyeon in interviews: 🥰🥺🙈😊😇
No one:  Litterally no one:  Minnie: SEÑORRRRRRRRITA
Yuqi: ah aH AH icE CREAM Minnie: BLACKPINK ICE CREAM  girl she was so excited screaming blackpink 🥺
G idle is literly  One of the LOUDEST groups ever and that's why I like them
miyeon and blackpink crumbs THE WAY MINNIE SAID BABY
SOYEON: This song(Dynamite) was #1 on Billboard. Everyone knows that song.  My ARMYLAND hearteu🥺
Everyone: “I’m the baaaaad guyyyy... duh” Yuqi: “I’m the baaaad guyyyy... DUCK”
When they said BLACKPINK my eyes automatically went to Miyeon
"*Miyeon, Soojin & Shuhua:* Contemplating the meaning of life. *Minnie & Yuqi:* ""We have to get these right, our lives depend on it."" *Soyeon:* ""This should be fun."""
No one: (G)idle: ice creammmmmmm blackpinkkkkk
oh my god Minnie is a fan of blackpink because minnie best friend of lisa... iloveit
Shuhua Soojin and Miyeon duration of the game: 👁👄👁
"soyeon: dynamite, bts my armyland heartueu: *boom boom*"
I WANT BLACKPINKxGidle collab. Cmon start the collabs. They will be unstoppable.
"If BTS and (G)I-DLE collaborate, that will be Boom!"
no one:  literally no one:  minnie: *breathes* yuqi: DO IT AGAIN
"This kind of game, Minnie,Soyeon and yuqi nailed it every time."
Soyeon knowing BTS dynamite is making me cry😢😢 Queens know kings very well
Popular Opinion: Everyone wants to see G-IDLE in real life.
Soyeon is so kind She say that Dynamite is popular 🙏🔥🔥
"I just live for 2:16 and wait for the day when BTS and GIDLE can meet formally   Let me be, I'm an clown"
"""I'm the bad guy""  Billie Eilish: Duh Yuqi: Duck"
Soyeon acknowledging Dynamite achievement Billboard no 1.  First idol to do that 👍🏼
"Yuqi and Minnie: ""TOXIC TOXIC, BRITNEY SPEARS TOXIC!!!"" Shuhua, Miyeon and Soojin internal thoughts: ""Who?!"""
No one: Literally no one: Soyeon: *on the stage😈💋* Soyeon: *in real 🥺🐥* Me: *what else I wanna see*
Minnie is a Swiftie and no can’t tell me she’s not
":how do u know?   Soyeon: this song was #1 on billboard, everyone knows this song AS YOU SHOULD QUEEN PERIODTTT"
"""I'm the bad guy, DUCK!!!"" - Yuqi, 2021"
"Soyeon "" this song was #1 on Billboard everyone knows this song ""     as an ArmyLand I've never been this happy  I hope they will have a collab someday"
Soyeon was right. Everyone knows the song dynamite even non-ARMYS!! 💜💜
"Warning: Turn down your volume, these girls have the tendency to scream a lot  EDIT: Yeah I see a lot of people doing this so... Thanks for the 4k guys!"
Soyeon recognizing straight away Dynamite by BTS my armyland heart still wants that collab😔
Miyeon to Soyeon after every song: How do u know this?
"this song is #1 on BB, everyone knows this song🤭🤞"
Alternative Title: Yuqi spreading chaotic energy for 5 mins straight
"Minnie, soyeon y Yugi: 🙋🙋🙋   Soojin, miyeon y shuhua: 😶😶😶"
Soyeon is so cute when she said to BTS dynamite.
"Soyeon: the definition of being humble, but you kinda nailed everything. stan the genius"
when minnie said senõrita the same way she did in “i’m the trend” lmaooo
"Yuqi Fangirling Over Minnie's "" Rum Pum Pum Pum Pum Pah"" Is why I pay my internet bills."
"Minnie: ""Rrrrrrraaaa pam pam pam""  Yuqi: ""three more times, again, again"" 🤣💀"
Nah I’m crying soyeon smiling and gently saying dynamite by bts And the fact that she’s my bias YEAH IM HAPPY
that was the quietest Shuhua has ever been
"They could rename this video to ""Minnie & Yuqi being best friends for almost 6 minutes""."
"""SENORRRRITA"" ""RRRM pa pam"" the girl surely knows how to roll 'em R's"
"Soyeon is literally just answering like: 🙂 Meanwhile Yuqi, Minnie: 🤪🤯🤬😎😩🥳 Also Soojin, Shuhua, and Miyeon: 🤨😐😄"
This is literally just Minnie supporting her bestie Lisa in secret 😂
Soyeon knows everything  Me : im not surprised. I mean cmon she is a producer for a reason. 😂
"soyeon has so much presence on stage that i forgot she’s very sweet and kinda reserved off stage, well reserved compared to Yuqi"
"Nobody:   Miyeon every time Minnie,Soyeon and Yuqi gets the song right: **How do you know**"
I need the kind of confidence yuqi has while singing the very wrong lyrics of a song
Soyeon just calmly said the answer while other screamed everytime while answering 😂
Soyeon knowing Doja Cat’s Say So completes my life.
Nobody: Minnie: SEÑORRRRRRRITA
Soyeon was really just sitting there looking like a tiny baby omg I wanna hug her🥺
"""everyone having time of their lives and trying to guess"" soojin : i just dont get paid enough for this shit"
"soyeon is a whole different person off stage, look  at this shy cinnamon roll that spits fire on the stage"
I will STAN g(idle) bc they are so kind OMG
Soyeon in every video:        *LeTs gEt iT!!*
No one's talking about how beautiful Shuhua is
Even I couldn't guess Dynamite and I'm a big Army 😭. Soyeon did it. I'm proud of her
No one:  Minnie: RRRRRRRAMPAPAMPAPA SEÑORITAAAAAAA
2:21 YAS QUEEN TELL EM
"How Soyeon and Minnie pronounce ""Camila Cabello"" :'D"
Me looking at miyeons face when talking about bp.
"Minnie and Yuqi looks like the life of the party. They're so comical, loud and FUN"
Minnie and Yuqi: AH AH AH I KNOW IT LET ME TELL THE NAM- Soyeon: *says the name before everyone*
"this video sums up the energy of gidle, soojin wants to go home, minnie and yuqi look like they're on crack, soyeon is being a shy talented queen, miyeon doesn't know what's going on, if only shuhua was breakdancing or somenthing this would be a perfect summary"
in minnie and yuqi blinks trust also soyeon being a whole ace in sound
"Just one thing to clarify for international Nevies💕 When Miyeon said “How do you know all these songs?” (4:08) they misinterpreted a little - she said “어떻게 알아?” and this can be translated to “How do you know ( )?”. Here the subject was omitted and in the video they translated it as “How do you know all these songs?” But in this context it’s more like “How do you know (all these songs after hearing only that)?” or “How could you tell?”  Obviously she knows the songs like Senorita and all the other songs, it was just hard to guess the right answer!😂 But again she is really bad at games😂😂😂"
alternative tittle: minnie and yuqi plays 8 bit melody challange ft. soyeon (for korean songs)
*Didn’t expect Soyeon to kill this quiz. she knows a lot of pop songs even the old popular.*
Who love g-idle😍
as an army thank you and i will support you guys from now on
"I love the energy of lisa's friend Minnie and the girl beside her, they're so funny and loud lol"
Producer line knows a lot of songs omg
I don't even stan them but omg their so cute! Im actually crying over this idk why
Minnie: 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣 Yuqi: 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣 Soyeon: 😁💖 Miyeon: 👁👄👁 Shuhua: 👁👄👁 Soojin: 👁👄👁 ........🤧
I am happy army's are respectful in this comment section 💜💜💜 happy that we should never have fanwars with these good girl groups and every GRP too💜💜✨✨
"soyeon saying ""this song was #1 on billboard, everybody knows this song"" about dynamite, SO TRUE QUEEN"
"Miyeon , Shuhua & Soojin throughout the whole video : *why are we still here ?*"
Soyeon: dynamite everyone know about this song 💅💜
Am I the only one waiting for Miyeon to guess Blackpink song here? she was so confused same with soojin & shuhua AHAHAHAHAHAHAHWHAHWHW
Yuqi that kind of friend who’s very loud
"Minnie, Soyeon and Yuqi just killed this game, omg"
"1:40 why was Soyeon looking at Miyeon like ""Do something about your child."""
"I was smiling the whole time and the fact that I am Neverland, Army, Blink and Swiftie."
Yuqi and Minnie are literally screaming during the whole video😂😂😂
"The energy in this video : SOYEON : Everyone knows this song. YUQI : ICE CREEEAAAM!!!! MINNIE : SENNIIIOORRRITAAA!!! MIYEON, SOOJIN, SHUHUA :..?"
"When minnie said ""justin bieber baby I was just like can you be my baby too"
"Soojin is like the ""I'm alive but I'm dead"" meme lmao"
Minnie knows all the songs of blackpink literally girl you yuqi and soyeon nailed it I'm not a g( idol) stan but still wow girls wow

"""Listen boy"" and ""Rrrrrap monster!"" will never get old."
me: *watches this*  my last 2 brain cells: *have left the chat*
I think the reason my remaining braincells are so chaotic is because of them. I blame my braincells on BTS.
_ _*_Kookie's : existed_*_ _   _ _*_Army's : gives him everything we have_*_ _
"Idk why, but they radiate big baby energy, and jimin’s little feet stomps lol🤣"

Vhope: **giving instructions** Jin: 🤏🏼🤛🏼👌🏼👉🏼🖐🏼 Vhope: “sure”
1:45 everybody gangsta until hobi the oblivious sunshine starts flirting   even yoongi struggled to keep his swag on what a cutie 🥺
"*Staff: ""We turned on the switch""* *Jin: ""Let's just say It's because I pressed it""*  This is so much like Jin"
2:03 Suga is so cute..Also the editing is awesome..
*My last 2 braincells: “taekook is real!”* (ıT wAs A jOkE>)

Last time I was this early namjoon still had permed hair

0:41 it's me just me 😂😂😂
BTS are truly the reason why my brain cells are *GONE* 😭🤚🏽
3:06  *Taetae is me* *Jimin is my teacher.*
"Hoseok being a teaser to Yoongi and making him have a gay panic in national television, ah."
"Fact: if you don't know from where ""LisTen BoY mY fiRst LoVe stORy"" came from search GEE"
"4:37 after all this, do you still believe he's the eldest...coz I don't :)"
"Hobi: ""SMILE""  Jin: *in his own world* HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH"
0:37 : Jungkook.exe has stopped working
0:42 seriously it's me. Whenever I am alone in my room I always shout fanchant in my room and my mum once came and asked me if I was summoning a demon or something 😂😂

“please dance to On”  Yoongi: *a seaweed*
"These aren't my last two bran cells, they ARE my brain cells😂😂😂     If you didn't get it I meant the way they're acting is the way I act all the time😂😂"
Idk why but I never feel like watching an internationally famous boyband trying to cook...this feels like me and my friends trying to cook. They're so relatable it's scary
1:44 everybody gangsta until hobi starts flirting
Hey am early! But my heart ached when taetae was asked about his first love story. I mean look at his expression. 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 Aww don't worry tae you'll get your princess soon!! And we will stan that queen!
"Jungkook: there is plain,hard,strong something else flour   Rm: weak flour... Jungkook:....."
don’t even ask me where did i get my crackhead energy 🥲🌝
Jimin is so cute🥺
Oye why is no one talking about Jin's reaction to sniffing vinegar? Lmaooo💀💀😹😹
"I am not bored , my books are wide opened in front of me , but still I am gonna..."
Your channel is honestly the reason why I'm living at the moment. Thank you for making life better.
I love jimin and how funny he is I need he as my boyfriend.
Jung kook: 🥺 왜? Every single person on Earth: awwwww!
let me tell yall that yoongi couldnt make eye contact with hoseok that night because he can only look at me (◡‿◡)
Suga - you are trained cook Jin - blush no no i just press it and it turn          On Team - we turn it on Jin - blush smile and slowly say just say that it turn on because I press that 😂😂
Namjoon just wants to learn more things and Jin is thinking Namjoon is going to get hurt. Namjoon just wants to learn more things so Jin just let him. Namjoon wants to try new things even though he might get hurt. hehehe. Reading whatever the  English Subtitles can't never be the funniest to read.
"My braincells at 2 am: Rrrrrap monster  Me: *""HeY sToB iT""* .... lemme sleep😂😂"
"Suga: ahh huh listen boi, my first love story!! 😀😂"
The face jin made after smelling vinegar 😂
JK is literally my spirit animal.
"i love how yoongi said ""oh sh*t i just zoned out"" so casually on run bts😂"
"Jin said none of my Bros getting hurt, not on my watch. I love him so much. He the best big bro ever💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
1:59 I actually felt so sad for Jin. He wants to experience it and go back to being a kid. I'M SOBBING NOW
"I was seriously bored and scrolling through my YouTube recommendations when I saw this and I was like ""YouTube knows me pretty well"" 😂😂"
Jin = Laugh
"I like how Hobi loves to teases Yoongi, And Yoongi always get flutter when he did so LMAO😂"
I like the way Taehyung was giving Jin more ideas of what to do in 2021😭
1:42 Me: Why does he look so tall? The only braincell left: He's wearing heels
7:03 finally we got to see yoongi version of rrrrap monster😁😂
_ _*_Jin's laugh is the actual reason why I laugh at his jokes._*_ _  _ _*_I can't StOb laughing rn_*_ _
"I’m crying😭😭😭when Jimin asked Yoongi to dance, he did the traffic dance Jin taught them a while back😭😭😭  3:25"
Somebody already disliked this vid I can’t😭
1:43 that Sope moment was the cutest and the Taejin one too  😍😍💜💜💜💜💜💜
"We absolutely need a soundtrack for ""Runt BTS"" Jimin, of course, should be the lead vocal"
J-Hope leading the Imperial March killed me
"I love Suga “listen boy, my first love story” 😂 it kills me every time"
"Jungkook remarking yoongi that he zoned out while his name is Jeon Zoning out Jungkook. I mean, the audacity"
😁 jimin in the thumbnail 😍😍💜
_ _*_I'm just 9 seconds in_*_ _ _ _*_I'm DYING & rolling on the floor_*_ _   _ _*_We ARMY'S stan 7 - LeJINdary Coated Crackheads_*_ _
Suga is so open with the members the cameras make him quite ...I can’t decide who’s my bias oh god
"Yoongis little ""listen boy, my first love story"" will NEVER not be iconic and adorable."
So...can we all agree that suga looked so cute in the ON era guys he looked so cute with that hair 😀
JINS FACE HERE 3:58 WHY WAS THIS SO FUNNY AHAHAH
7:44 I just love these expression of yoongi.❤️❤️.. whenever he understood something he does that..so cutee😭😭😭
"me feeling jin's discomfort when Tae  comes closer to him, jajaja but Yess is so true Abyss is a genius work"
The fact that ARMYs weren't screaming during Truth Untold signifies how mesmerizing this song is😭💜
The voice control jungkook has is outstanding..
*Truth Untold is Gold* 💜✨
The way armys are listening to their singing silently 😭🤧💜
Jin and jimin voice i can'tttt !!! 😭💜
Jin is the most beautiful person ever.
The Truth Untold is both heartbreaking and achingly beautiful.
"the way jin sings so passionatly, i cant"
This song is the reason why I became an army
"This song is actually based on a story. There was a man who lived in a big castle but kept to himself since he thought he wasn't beautiful. One day he found out that a woman came near his home and picked his flowers, he was angry at first but became curious of the woman and fell in love with her, but didn't say anything since he thought he was ugly (""can't show you me, give you me"") He planted very rare flowers so she could sell them for a bigger price, but one day she stopped coming by and the man found out that she had passed away. He regretted everything and wished he confessed to her (""if I stood up in front of you, would everything change now?"") And the line, ""i still want you"" means that he wants her back. If he loved himself then would be able to confess to the one he loves? As BTS once said... ""True love first begins with loving myself""❤️❤️"
"The biggest iconic when JIMIN,V ,AND JUNGKOOK JOIN JIN"
"No one talking about v's voice ,how perfectly he Sang the song . Everyone should be applauded equally 🙏💜"
When you realise the truth untold about about Jin’s silver voice💖
Jungkook really has a super good vocal control. It‘s insane💜
"Hello , I’m back here crying to this song for the 85837582847th time"
when jin started singing... i got teary... so emotional singing.
If Jin watches himself he must realise that he is an amazing singer. They all are but in this it's Jin who sends the tingles up my spine.
Taehyung is beautiful
Really appreciate the audience for listening to the song quietly.
Poor Jimin😭😭 I can’t imagine how hurt his throat is but he’s still trying for army💜💜💜💜💜
OMG I am so proud of my brothers jinvminkook
This just shows how talented the vocal line is  Jin vocals are no joke it's so good I can listen to it whole day  Jungkook vocals are so mesmerizing  Taehyung vocals are so great I can't explain  Jimin vocals are mesmerizing and just so great  Words cant explain how great  their voices are
💜❤️I LOVE THIS SONG 💘😊

I luv this song but V has a little bit of parts in it tho
Taehyung's voice is the most unique 💜
3:36 THE HARMONY GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS😳
Jin💜
But I still want you! Hits different 😭
"Everyone: watching four of them singing and talking about their voice and me: Jin , V , Jungkook in white shirt and Jimin in Black . why? I know it not a joke but 😂🤣"
"Doctor:you have 4,42 min.left to live Me:I'll watch this video 😭😭"
Jin 😍
"Wow, superb! So many amazing parts, but JK at 3:54 .... woah!"
"Jimin's high note is, life"
Jk voice always amazes me
"It’s crazy that Jin performs this immediately after his solo, and he still goes all out! Stable king."
when jins part came on my sister asked “who is that?”  i was like: That’s WWWH worldwide handsome Jin
Jk:but i still want you Me: this I what I am telling for the past years.. Atleast u got it now😌😜

2:42 goosebump

1:49 idk but where is JK tucking his thumb? I'm sure the belt loops ain't that low... 👁️👄👁️ I srsly don't know why I noticed that 💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤦
"When jin started to sing, I felt Goosebumps.... One of the greatest creation of BTS Vocalists ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
Jin 🥺❤️
JIN YOUR VOCALS
Mi jungkook tiene una voz de angel😍😍😍😍😘 igual todos 😄
4 angles singing..😭💜 and blessing my ears ..☺️💜

"Poor Jimin, he tried so hard for ARMY, his voice was still amazing though"
2:44 Taehyung’s incredible vocals with that baritone voice 😭💯
"Wait a minute, so JK sings, harmonizes with the other 3 and does the adlibs?!!! Omg!"
"Me being Sobbing, I love them so much and their voices touch deep of my heart 'sniffing'"
"3:54 is the most beautiful part to me, I find the other ones beautiful as well but this really makes me emotional"
Let's all wear white and not tell Jimin. hahahahahahah
So beautiful meaningful song...... 💜
I always get back to this live performance. It's so soothing and satisfying at the same time.
jin's voice is angelic😭💜
Jin..💜 world wide handsome💜😍
"Oh My God Armies froze in their places it's like they are listening to a National Anthem, this is amazing"
I want more of this track please!! 😭😭
Love you bts 💜💜💜 Purple you taehyung 💜🥰🥰😘😘❣️❣️
Jungkook and the gang🙄    V deserves more😭
"Eu lembro de uma parte do show q o Jimin tira o fones de ouvido e ele começa a chorar pq os armys estavam cantando com eles,esse momento foi tão lindo,sou army tb e tenho orgulho q gostar deles 💕💕🌷"
Awww i love all voices mostly jungkooks
Jim ... is my debilitate 🥺💜
"At that time, Taehyung had fever amd Jimin's throat was sore. ): Baby's are still singing. 🥺"
"Esta cancion es especial para mi, me hace acordar a mi mejor amigo, mi mama no confia en el cree que me hara daño y me prohibio volverlo a ver, cada vez que oigo esta cancion recuerdo sus abrazos, los besos que me daba en la mejilla, cuando escucho esta cancion siento que esta junto a mi, cuando escucho esta cancion lloro y abrazo a mi peluche de BT21, mi peluche me hace acordarme de el, lo extraño tanto, ojala mi madre entienda que el es un amigo para mi y que no me haria daño realmente no me arrepiento de conocer a BTS los amo mucho y nunca me arrepentire de ser army"
When Jimin hits his high note at the end
Jinnnnnnnnnnnn😘🥰🥰
Jungkook amazing voice captures so much of emotions. Incredible
"Its ok, I cried, you cried, everyone cried, pls dont comment anywhere ""Imagine that BTS will disband after years"" BECAUSE MY POOR HEART WILL EXPLODE OMG"
i think i saw jimin crying 😭 💜💜
I feel so bad for jimin...cause he has the highest note and he hurt himself as well...
I like how ppl talk about JIn more now. But let's not forget about our Chim chim yall
Army's are fire on rap line songs Calm and silent on vocal line songs
I was today year’s old when I realized their ear pieces match their mics.☺️
What a fate. World best vocalists are together
"after Life Goes On, this is my anthem!"
"As an Army myself, I just want to say that ARMYs are the ""BEST""!!!! I mean it from the bottom of my heart 💓"
V voice ❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜💜💜💜
"Tae oppa, deep voice makes me goosebumps"
"Que plateia mais organizada né?  No Brasil as Armys estariam gritando loucamente, cantando junto, tanto que o jimin até se emocionou 🥰"

Love Maknae Vocal my babies JinMinVKook...❤❤💜💖💖
Omo the truth untold is my all time favourite 🥺💜💫even I'm gonna make a cover after my band's debut but no one can beat their voice🤧 saranghae bangtan and army 💜
When she said “Rebekah has no skills”  I felt that
"""Last episode, we made our first enemy"" Fake Chelsea Impiccishmay: 👁👄👁 was i a joke to you?"
Who’s gonna tell her there’s 13 aspirations now and not 12?
“Tom Holland is stalking my daughter” is not something I thought I’d ever hear someone say?
"She named the new girls “baby” and “Jane”. If you have watched Jane The Virgin, you would know that there is Jane and then when Rogelio has a baby he names her baby. That’s crazy!"
WHO HAS BEEN HERE SINCE OLIVE?!
"""even after you were tired of playing the sims, you kept playing the sims. because we needed you to. what a hero."" me to kelsey lmao. thanks for keeping this challenge going !"
"Namjoon: ""wait, i thought I was your baby daddy"" Kelly: ""sorry bae""  **Namjoon's verse in Cypher Pt. 4 intensifies**"
I don’t know if she’s been checking the prices of the violins in the museums but there is one violin that is super expensive that she should try to steal.
"Name idea- Phineas and Ferb after the show then you can say ""Ferb I know what were gonna do today"""
"Episode 1 Kelsey: ""They're not my kids"" Episode 74 Kelsey: ""I had 83 kids"""
"For a girl: Kiara, after Simba’s daughter in the lion king."
Can we get a cross over where you download dr Mike's sim and set him to work in this hospital so he can deliver Kelly's babies? :')
"Girl: Lavender, Penelope or Gwen Boy: Liam, Fred or Duncan"
Accidentally referencing “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?”
"Can we all agree that the last baby of this challenge should be called Kelsey! It's a unisex name, so works for boy or girl!"
We need some the Office names for this challenge!!
Kelsy: my girls love cutting their hair when they become a teen. Me and my best friends: 😳 we did that...
i love how sim bts seem to always fit actual bts! like how yoongi really does play guitar and taehyung plays violin & loves art museums! not to mention meeting namjoon in the friends cafe...its either a fun coincidence or whoever made these sims did a lot of background work haha!
Episode 7 of reiterating that if Kelly has a baby with Taehyung and doesn’t name it Yeontan we riot. 😐
Imagine having to tell everybody you’re single almost every week for 2 years
"""Classic disney princess..kiss the boy, make him love you and run away!!"" 😂😂😂😂😂 I laughed so hard"
If they’re changing the upload schedule they could at least let us know?
"The ""seok"" in Hoseok and Seokjin is pronounced closer to like a mix between ""soak"" and ""sook"" rather than ""see-oak"""
i wish playing video games would increase your school grades in real life too lmao
i can't even believe that this series is almost finished. i still remember when the first episode came into my recommended  2 years ago! i'm going to be so sad when it ends. for the past 2 years it always make my day 10 times better when a new episode comes out <3
Me still waiting patiently for a mermaid baby
"Other BTS Fans: I'm a  big fan, I have all the albums, been to multiple concerts, and even got their autograph.  Kelly Impiccishmay: But did you have babies with all of BTS?  Other Fans: ...No Kelly Impiccishmay: AMATEURS!"
Ma’am how is she still single-
it feel so weird but also so natural to be back in this house
"This series is my Saturday morning cartoon. I know it's ending soon, but what a wild ride it has been! Thanks, Kelsey!"
I can’t believe this series has been going on for over a year 😂
When you realise episode 1 was 2 years ago-
"Boy: Hades, Apollo, Zeus, Poseidon,  Girl: Venus, Hera, Artemis, Persephone  (I love greek mythology if you cant tell)"
I low key want Kelly to end up with her doctor in the end lmao
Yoongi is playing guitar and taehyung us playing violin  Just like they do in real life 👀👀
Ahahahaha i lost it when she called Jin « SEOkjin Kim » 😂😂👌
Kelly over here doing what almost all of us ARMY wish we could do...
Kelly over here doing what almost all of us ARMY wish we could do
"I’m not going to lie, I’m going to be sad when the 100 baby challenge ends."
J-hope watching this: 👁️👄👁️                                  Damn she's fertile....
“He’s playing a little hard to get” yup that’s kim taehyung right there
‘Buy two easels?’ ‘I’ll just swap the paintings on the wall’
Rain is Rainn Wilson as Dwight Schrute. Talk about art imitating life.
She’s stealing arts and stealing hearts
"This series has been going on for two years and the only thing I can think of is ""She's STILL single?"""
Image hearing the “aging up babies” music or “eating for two” music anywhere but here ID BE TRIGGERED!
When the shows over we should count the totally name mess ups for the whole challenge 😂
'Excited for a day in the MÜSÈM' AHAHAHHAHAH Kelsey you killed me with that one
What if Kelly started stealing expensive painting and replacing them with her own lol
Tae playing the violin in Sims... The irony!
"whenever kelly stole and then immeadiatly got a phone call, i thought it said ""hi kelly, i've heard you've been stealing things"" but it actually said ""hi kelly, we've heard some stellar things about you..."" and i about died lol"
this started when i was 14 and i’m still watching... congratulations on being the one thing iv actually kept interest in
"I know we all love books here, so could you call a girl Primrose?"
21:43 Kelly almost didn't pass the Taehyung vibe check
I can’t wait for you too reach 100 babies and at the same time I’m already low key depressed that it’s almost over 😂😂😢😭
Baby and Jane is roghilio the father (Jane the virgin fans only will understand) HAHAHHA but they were like 20+ years apart
I swear when this ends I’m gonna cry
Jane’s father named his baby “baby” in jane the virgin omg
I didn't know J-hope has some love affair  xD  Why is Big Hit hiding it from us ??? Like seriously why?!
"I smile every time it says ""sup boys"" at the start"
As a nurse it hurts my heart when you steal a chair from the hospital. There are never enough chairs at the nurses station when you want to write your notes. You are stealing precious seats from the poor nurses who are in their feet all day 😭
Your twins are a Rod Stewart song.
Lol today I'm watching this on J-hope's birthday! 😆😆😆
I’ve been committed to this series for longer than any of my relationships... that being said I think you need a baby Kerrigan 💕
Kelly's favorite romance book would 100% be Dont Go Stealing My Heart bc its basically her inside a fanfic
Kelsey in part 1: Chelseas kids not mine Kelsey in part 74: I had 83 kids in the sims 4!
Loki: finishes his project and happy dances Kelsey: Omg good job loki he's so proud of it!! Also Kelsey: *immediately sells it*
You should really check out the museums and art centres that have been created in the gallery for you! 😊
For a girl: Bianca  for a boy: Eugine 🥰🥰
So I was today years old when kelsey made me realised you can dragged unfinished paintings off the easel and put them back on. RIP to all the painting I just scrapped away
i watched this series from last year and i was shocked to see part 74 i was like wtf. why did that took so long  Bruh
Namjoon caring about his baby is as always on brand
not me just now realizing that naming the twin girls Baby and Jane reminds me of “Whatever Happened to Baby Jane” 👀
Wow I haven't watched this for a year and is still not over
Dwayne really is like his mom. A klepto artist!
"For V if its a boy: Tae and for a girl: Saxony(ik its a place but it reminds me of the saxophone, the instrument he once played)"
“We’ll only have to have 15 more babies” I felt panic there. I’m not ready for this series to end... 😭
Its funny how both kaya and rain are both wearing turquoise!
I’m not sure what I’m going to do after this is over
"Ironic that there's a movie called, ""What ever happened to Baby Jane?"""
Rebekah literally loves everyone and everything. I'm here for it. Also I pray for Dwayne as he is a perfectionist and a painter and I can imagine how hard that might be >.<
You should name a baby Joey so you can ask them “How you doin’?”
i just realised... what am i supposed to do after this series is over .__.
Kelly should be a famous artist who sells her paintings to the museums only to come back and steal them later 🤣
"The main character of my Harry Potter fanfic is December, or Deci for short"
"No one gonna talk about the fact that lighting struck on Loki’s birthday 😳 Also can you name a baby Sidney , Lexi , or Brooke after me and my sisters"
just sayin in jane the virgin jane's half-sister is named baby so...
"I know that you love the avatar (ATLA) because you were singing „secret tunnel“ as  „breakfast salad“ so I’d say a possible baby name could be Iroh, Zuko, Azula or Katara :)"
I can't believe how far behind I am now. (I had a baby😂)
Waiting for them to post again!! 🙃
Kelly looks so much like her dad in the heist outfit!
“Rebekah has no skills” literally same
I'm going to freak out if Kelsey and real Tom Holland ever start dating 😍😂
Wow Kelly's really living as Y/N now
One skill that’s really fast is when u use a basketball hoop for the fitness skill. Just keep pressing “dream big” and they will level their fitness skill up really fast.
I really just want to know where Kelsey got her sweater!!
"I’ve always loved the names Chandler and Rusty for a set of girls - they’re a lil out there but I think they’re sweet 🥰 thanks for brightening my quarantine, Kelsey!"
"I though she said ""an extra outfit for teething"" xD"
"I’m currently on my lunch break, eating a salad, watching this.... oops"
"My sister got that same badge maker for Christmas, it is so much fun to use! You are way better at using the paper cutter than I am. When I use it the paper is very rough and torn. XD"
"Being able to customise all your things to your liking is such a dream come true, sadly I'm broke hahaha"
"No one: Minori: ""cutely singing"" 'ChOke me Like you HatE me~'"
The pin badge maker looks like a really weird microscope😂😂😂
Minori : *posts for the first time in 2021*  My 2021: *instantly better*
No one:  Me after I saw a green among us bean with leaf : WhaT iS uP GuYs SyKkuNo HeEEEeeREeeEE
"I really recommend drawing Disney characters, or twisted wonderland characters! I think them in your chibi cartoony art style would be cute <3"
POV: Your thinking of a good comment to write
"YESS she's back   I missed the ""Hey guys it's me minori! And my pet baymax.""🥺"
Me: sees RJ in the thumbnail Me: clickes faster than light Me: I am speed
"You're allergic to your hamsters? 👀 I thought I was the only one, cleaning out my rabbit's cage makes my asthma terrible but I love my little dumpling so I'm willing to make sacrifices 😂"
"Me seeing the pokemon drawings: ""KAWAII!!!!😍😄"""
Nobody: Minori: choke me like you hate me- Me: there is 1 imposter in the cute girl's world
Woooaa.. Corpsekunno literally same level as anime now... imagine they have anime.. are you smiling? :)
私も仕事で業務用使うけど、無心になって数百個あっという間に作れるから、何にも考えたくないときとかいいかも
I need that t shirt........... SIRIUSLY. (along with the Weasley sweater)
When you started singing Corpse 😂 The pitch of your voice went 📉📉📈📉📉 Oh Minori you never fail to make me laugh 👌🏾
I swear everything Minori draws is adorable 🥺🥺

"みのりんがこんな時間に投稿するの珍しい,,,,,"

I like to imagine that when Minori cut herself her blood didn't look red it looked like glittery pink

MINORI IS A CORPSE SIMP LIKE ME I LOVE IT  Edit: AHHHH A LIKE FROM MINORI ILYSM

As soon as I saw zenitsu and Hanako *my excitement came*
Day 20000 of asking minori to draw ✨jojo characters✨
I've been checking her channel to see if she posted yet so I was excited she posted today psidlfylsyfld

I envy the can batch maker! Are you okay with the injury              あ、日本人います？
Everything is forgiven when Minori smiles 🥺🥰😍❤️ btw i am a very big fan of you Minori and would be so happy if you replied
"I SWEAR SHES AN ANGEL?!!!!! She inspired me so much, I’m going to an art high school This year, and during covid and the holidays I’ve been watching her, she’s made me do a lot more art than I would usually do on a daily basis, she made me feel excited whenever I would pull up my art book,  She made me feel better about my drawings! I even started a manga with my dad, because I love her vids when She would turn shows and movies into manga pages, she even helped me a lot with my art style, and I’ve gotten so many art supplies that I would of never knew I needed, like a tracing box ect! I just would like her to notice this, so she knows that we all love her!🥰☺️😍"
No one noticed baymax wearing minori merch So cute UwU
会えた記念として、街で声をかけてくれた人に缶バッチプレゼントって…良い人過ぎる🥺✨
"Imma just say that if you know Obey Me and A3, then I recommend you drawing it!!! Genshin impact and Animal crossing are also very popular and I think it would be awesome to see you recreate some characters (｡’▽’｡)♡"
"""Choke me like you hate me"" xD  -corpse's and minori's fan 👇"
Minori: I'm going to give them away to people who recognise me me: *starts making a plan to meet her*
day 7 of asking minori to play genshin impact and reminding her she's an amazing person
The reason that I love Minori is  that  she has the same name as my school nurse and they are both talented!
Do you think you could do Tsukasa Yugi and Mitsuba Souske from TBHK? Tysm! Ilysm Minori-sama <3
Please do 'a day in my life'❤️
i’m early but i don’t know what to say so act like i said something relatable

Why is nobody responding to her Harry's Weasley sweater I❤️ it!!
"day 15 (missed another day but are we rlly surprised), of asking minori to play genshin impact and reminding her she's an amazing person"
1. Did you cut your hair?  2. Who else kept checking back every Friday at 5 pst to see if she uploaded a new video but she didnt so you just kept binge  watching all her videos👊🏾😔
Me seeing you draw Pikachu: * insert Yashiro saying kawaii *
minori trying to do corpse's voice is so funny and cute ^^ love ya <3
i cant imagine minori with:  rock music in the background  yelling instead of speaking  being mad  not being obsessed with among us  uh yea   ILY MINORII!!                                             you read it all?                                 wow..                                ok ima stop LOL
This is a fact that everybody can speak her name very perfectly no matter from where you belong for whatever language you speak
"Watching Minori and some other artist do digital art makes it look easy, but when you actually do it, it's really hard🤣"
"It is just me, or does Minori have her special way to hold her stylus while drawing on the iPad?"
I really like her accent!😍 It's kinda relaxing! 😅
Minori is so cute :)
I think she should put the original Minori badge as part of merch!
day 4 of asking minori to play genshin impact and reminding her she's an amazing person
I love  that you are always happy it makes me smile. Who wants Minori to try another 24 hours drawing challenge like when she drew Hermione
"Fun fact: people will read your comment when you start it with a ""fun fact"""
waaah Minori they are beautiful 😭😭😭💙 the pikachu one is my fav 🥺
When I saw Sykkuno and Corpse characters I just got so happy
Yo al ver los pins de Sykkuno y Corpse: *[Scream]*

Minori's Hiiii warms my heart....
何気に切る作業が1番大変そう🙄
You speak so well in Japanese and English
Taehyung isn’t werid he is just unique.
In conclusion: Taehyung acts the same on and off camera. His uniqueness is so adorable ♥
V is unique. Not many is like him.
Taehyung’s  unique personality and charms is what I love about him.
"I am a mom of 4. And 50 years old already. My Lovable ""V"" brought me to BTS."
V brought me to bts..i love him so much
Taehyung’s lovable charms can make anyone smile.
Last time I was this early Suga wasn’t secretary fluent in English
"He is not easily understood because he is too pure and straightforward when it comes to express. This kind of things are rare. But he adores his members a lot, he cares abt them."
Taehyung is limited edition. It's hard to find SOMEONE like him.
"There’s so much talk about how Tae has matured, or that he changed because of depression. In my opinion though, depression aside, he’s just mellowed out as any mid-20s person does. That level of energy in your teens doesn’t come to you as often as you age, or it becomes gentler. It’s just what happens biologically or something."
I love Tae's personality. Tae's talent and personality is the reason I got into BTS in the first place. It was so precious to hear Jimin say Tae's personality is why they are such great close friends. Also this clearly shows that Tae's more muted personality was to please other group members so hopefully people will stop wondering why Tae changed or wanting Tae to be like he was in the early days. He changed out of love for his members and what they wanted. He changed to make his fellow members happy. Tae again being the happiness preacher of the group.
*Tae is quite an enigmatic character  in some ways*
Taehyung is not weird. he has his own personality and it cute 🥺💜
Kim Taehyung Is The One & Only Limited Version Created By THE GOD.
"Fans are attracted to Tae, because he shows us that it's okay to be different.  That's it's okay to be yourself."
V is a unique person  with a unique personality💜
"""changed in a positive way"" ""coz he started to caring more about the happiness of other members and not just himself"" ""Tae's change in personality was for his other bts members"" . . . *meanwhile Blue & Grey lyrics:* ~""I guess everyone's happy. can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey""~ . ~""Oh this ground feels so heavier I am singing by myself""~ . ~""My color hidden with a smile, blue and grey""~ . ~""i just wanna be happier is it to much to ask""~ . ~""Don't say it's okay 'Cause it's not okay""~  uhm.. is it just me or was the ""change"" taking a toll on him?  i hope not.. i found it ironic tho.. BTS songs always preaches about ""loving yourself"" ""accepting yourself"" that ""being different is okay"" yet with Tae is is labelled ""weird"" ""alien"" ""4d"" some even call him ""dumb"" for thinking differently. why was there a need for Tae who was being himself (Suga said so himself, Tae's personality is same irl) to change to accommodate what his members and society want? SK is big on defining characters based on blood types and Tae is the only one who has AB bloodtype in BTS and it explains why he is different. thats his genes. He isnt trying to be ""different"" thats just who he is..  ahh.. this hurts my brain. i wish im wrong. If not, then maybe thank God for Wooga and now i understand why Tae calls them ""family"" and not just hyungs"
He's so pure and innocent..... His personality is something that inspires me the most..... Like he doesn't show off..... He's the same inside out.....
*He has the biggest heart and cares deeply about those closest to him*
"He is innocent, not just good. I mean, we know people can be good but not innocent, not at the age of 25. But here Taehyung is, without any efforts, still have his innocence.😍"
"That's coz he grew up with his Grandma. He is more open, friendly & softer/gentler."
He is just unique and many army fall in love with him by this personality he doesn't need anything or anyone to shine because for the person who loved him he is brightest star in their universe
POV: you're early and dk what to comment
V is very unquie he can be friendly with anyone he wants  He's different personality from other and thats why he can attract so many army including me 😁😁💜
"I noticed BTS because of Taehyung. One word is not enough to describe him. You just can’t help but be drawn to him and as you get to see him more you can see his genuine personality and his love for Army’s. You could tell he has a very good and positive influence on a lot of people, Army or not. Just look at all the birthday projects under his name globally. Shout out to all the fans who loves Taehyung, all of you are as amazing as Taehyung is. 🙂"
Fun fact: This is capricorn's unique personality.. Kool kids!!
Moral of the story        *Tae is unique and special* *He's a rare precious gem*
"Tae is not weird, he just being himself, to be one of a kind person.  "" To shine your brightest light is to be who you truly are."" 💜💜💜💙💙💙❤️❣️"
When you are too early:👁️👄👁️
".My friends say constantly Imma weird s human being BUT they've NEVER told me to stop ""doing weird things"" or to ""change"" because they didn't/can't understand me. That made me sad.. I guess I won't be able to met nor be friends with them. xd"
Why be ordinary? If you can be extraordinary😊😁👌👍💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Taehyung is not wiered he is just limited edition with a golden and a purple heart♡
V is someone I feel comfortable with. he is different from others
Wht?akward ?plz be carefull when select a tittle for our anpanmen  V isnt akward ...he is soo natural ...he is soo lovable ...he is unique ... He is the purest hearted man in this world
"Maturity is a good thing,,,,, that's time to enter his life ,,people changes with their ages, experience, incident,,  It's natural thing,,,  It's okay to be what  he is now,,,in his heart somewhere in the corner has still his old personality,, 💜💕 Army don't say that why he's changed,,, understand his feelings"
"When I got to know the BTS members more closely, I thought that they were too good to be true.  It was then I realized that perfect people also exist"
"The thing about Taehyung is that he is not predictable, his enthusiasm happens  sporadically and that’s what makes him so unique and adorable but not weird."
world need more people like him.
And that's why we 💜 him
And that's way we LOVE him THAT WAS THE REASON THAT WAS THE REASON 💖💖💖💖💖💜💜💜💜
V is very unique and one of a kind. I can relate to him as I can act like him. His has a creative and special mind too. 😊💜 Maturing is one thing but his original personality is always going to be there.
"Tae is one of his kind, no one can be like him, he’s just ✨UNIQUE✨"
"It's sad to know that in the early days the members wrote to him to not be 'weird' or do 'peculiar' things. But I'm glad that they now know and love taehyung for who he is. For me, it was taehyung that caught my attention and attracted me more towards BTS. I loved his unique personality and did find him absolutely adorable. And when I see him now more mature i feel pleased that he's gotten serious but yet still retains that uniqueness he possessed when he was younger.  Ps. Im talking like i have seen him since a child and it's weird coz he's older than me😅"
The way you see a person varies from culture to culture. Tae-Hyung May be strange or different either way III appreciate him for who he is. Being unique is a good thing :) perhaps it's more important to focus on the good side of being different rather than making a person change to suit everyone else. Tae is certainly fascinating and I appreciate that about him. :D Seems like he has become more beloved since he did not change for them and the other members see the good side of him more and now they have changed instead of Tae I love that.
Who’s bias is the legend Kim taehyung ?
"In the last picture, Tae looks like Jungkook."
I've never seen someone as amazing as taehyung my whole life 😗 he's so adorable and unique.... There's nothing like him
Taehyung is cute and perfect...as he is..not weird..he is so adorable 💜
"V is 💜cute , handsome , awesome , adorable , caring , unique personality 💜😍"
i just open my eyes now after 8 hrs sleep and see why BTS members are awkward with Taehyung .. my MOm : *giving me a whole lecture in perfectly Jin's rapping style*
The reason why I got into BTS is also V💜...Love U V❤️
"And being drop dead gorgeous helps to cement the person called ""V"" who ARMYS love so much.🐯💜"
I love Taehyung's radiant smile. He's my bias but I love all of them.💜
"Tae Is UNIQUE not weird, and 💜𝗕𝗧𝗦⟭⟬💜 isn't awkward around him 😑"
V is unique in so many ways.💜✌
Now he has biggest fan following among all the members.  the sweetheart of sKorea
"There's nothing about Tae, that's **weird** our Tae is unique in his own way... He's as rare as gold and he's a precious jem that we don't want to lose... He's our one and only Taebear and we're grateful for having him🥺💜"
TAEHYUNGGG AHH!🥺❤️
Its ok if he changed to other members' happiness. But I need to know about V's happiness after that. I was soo attached to his unique personality. Whenever I watche him its give me unstoppable laugh. But he chnaged. Im worried about the future. If he chanage more.....😢
"I really need someone like v In my life 💜 , well all needs."
He isn’t weird he is unique and such a good personality  He is so unique.       However             I LOVE HIM
"That’s Jin’s problem if he can’t reconcile with V’s personality, V should never change himself for anyone else. Suppressing who you really are for others is detrimental to your own mental health."
"Tae Tae is unique in his way, I find that interesting, I Luv him just the way he is {Mystery Man} 🥰"
"I don't think that taehyung is changed for the ""happiness of members"""
Every army thinks that Tae has became a silent person ....but it's not like that he has became a matured person who knows  when to joke around and when to be clam.  People think that he doesn't laughs much now ...it's not like that you can't force someone to smile every second even though their is nothing like smileing. Just know that he loves army's and if army's are happy he is too.💜
Being weird is the best thing that happened to me  -Taehyung   This is so true
So much for teaching people to love themselves and then go around telling Taehyung he should change his personality. Cold.
I think all the BTS members do unexpected things in the most unexpected ways. One cannot predict what they will do next. Yet Taehyung seems carefree but serious. He got a lot of ideas on a lot of subjects. Remember the latest Run episode?  He jokes with fans on weverse and his advices are noteworthy. Love seeing him now as Taehyung the mature free-spirited happy person.
"yes we can expect more changes but I don't want him to change 😣,  now he is mature and cares about other members too, and that's great, I don't want him to lose his unique and special personality, I don't want him to change anymore, I love his personality🥰"
Taehyung is a great person.
They all are so cute. V is lovely
"In a world plain of clones a personality as Taehyung is refreshing, I love how he  is thinking 💜🐯💜"
Tae has so unique personality💜
If taehyung is wierd then rest of the members are also wierd...
Hi :D
"Tae has indeed matured but we can all agree that the old tae comes out from time to time. But honestly, I missed the childlike tae ☺️"
"At the end of the day he is not fake. That's what brought more people into BTS. V is the most mature one out of the group. The fact that he is willing to change to accommodate other members in itself shows his sincerity and good nature. People love him cause he has the best character.  He is also the only one in group to say love all members. I think because V is more popular a lot of members feel uncomfortable or rubbed off by his personality, which is why he asks his fans to love all of them. He wants the people around him to be happy and loving cause he in general want nothing but happiness."
His unique personality is what makes him adorable.  It would be boring if everyone acted the same way all the time
we can agree that everyone in BTS has a very unique personality that can make armies heart bust the biggest and fatest UWU
Maybe because taehyung is pure he speaks truth always
"Remember when Jimin said once ""Guess I was a strange kid"", then RM said ""we were all a little strange back then""..V's unique personality is part of his charm Armys love💜"
Each member has their own distinctive lovely adorable personalities. That’s the uniqueness of BTS.
Whatever he do. I just love him. Cuz he different from others.
"Taehyung is an amazing individual person, god created him with his own unique personality. I love him being different from the others innocent, witty, lovable, friendly, easygoing, talented, charming, to name a few but most of all he is a good man and a good son that’s what I like about him. God bless you Taehyung 🙏💜 take care"
Tae tae is a precious unique boi 🥺
Tae is not weird.................... He is so  unique.......  :))
WHAT WAS THE REASON?! - cardi b
Bro this is sad. It basically means that v changed bc the members didnt accept him that way
It's tae's unique personality that made me in love with him... And I think many ARMIES are also effected by his unique and magnetic charms... I hope so he never changes again...
The reason why I became army is also cuz of him...at first I can't recognize them...but I can only recognize the face of V....idk how and slowly I like his personality...his mind is so soft and sweet and this the reason how became my bias 💜     Did anyone feel the same way???
"I became an Army bcoz of Kim Taehyung being himself video, 3 years ago. He is such a crackhead and free spirit, i've never seen someone so pure and innocent like him. Now he's mature and many ppl are missing his old TaeTae. Maybe he's change but my love for him would never change. He's change into a better person as he wrote many songs for Army."
They all thought he was weird including some of the armies... Now look at my baby!! He's matured so much!!! I
"Taehyung is such a adorable, sweet and angel like person his personality is unique and he has different perspective of viewing things and I really want him to stay just the way he is coz he's best the way he is💜"
I'm not an army but i like V's personality a lot. I love watching him perform and his smile can turn my bad mood drastically into good.  Because of him I learned to appreciate every BTS member because i saw how much he cares and appreciates each of them and its just so contagious...his positivity is so contagious.   Sometimes when we see something so good and kind we tend to be in denial that's it not real.  Maybe too good to be true but it's really true. V is really like that..he is real. 💜💟💜💟
We dont need any more changes we love him the way he is 🥺🥺
V’s weirdness (cuteness) is the one that lured me to BTS
Jin's and Suga's comments killed me. LOL Sin! V is unique and that's a charm.
"I wouldn't want him to change his personality because it is who he is.  We do, however, get older, and tend to do more mature things.   Taehyung will always be for me, the free-spirited individual who sees the beauty in all things."
The fact that he is the same when off camera as he is on camera is a sign of a pure spirit. He is not pretentious.

Bring some plot twist when  when company force tae and y/n to get married plx
"I eas abt to cry when jin said : my mothrly sense is tingling "" hahahahaha i cryed all right but crying from laughing ,😭😭😂😂😂😂"
2:29 I’m so touched that Yoongles said that he wouldn’t do it 🥰 I love him so much 🥺💜💜💜
Next part when you become sad because of hate comments and they confront you . Please 🙏🙏
Jin: I will whoop you with my brand new glitter pink slippers  Me: WHAT. U FINALLY REPLACED YOUR PINK FRYING PAN. YAY 👏👏👏👏congrats Y/N you got saved because it’s a slipper and not a frying pan.
Unnnie video recommendation for you to when.  Y/n goes over seas to meet parents and bts are alone
"The whole situation is preposterous, really! But, anyway, I like how Yoongi's character flat out says, ""I'm not doing it!"" And clearly he was not in on the prank (he wasn't just talking at breakfast or during practice); he didn't overtly do anything that would upset the 8th member. Instead of directly participating in the prank, he was at his studio. Plus, he found her."
Oh gosh Jin and his weapons! First pink frying pan and now brand new qlitter pink slippers!!! Don't dare to mess with him!!! AHAHAHA!!! LMAO! 🤦🏻‍♀😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💜💜💜💜
"Man, *I HATE FRICKEN PRACKS REEEEEEEEEEE* author-nim *UR SIRIES IS AMAZING EEK* Just like jimin said *""you nice keep going""* 💅💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💯✌👌❤🧡💛💚💙💜🍓🍓🍒☕☕☕☕🧁🎎🧸👑👑👑💴💴💴💵💵💵🟣🟣🇰🇷🇰🇷🇺🇲🇺🇲🇹🇹🇯🇲🇬🇾"
I was laughing at Jin while scolding😂😂😂😂😂😂i cant stop laughing
"unnie can you do a prank ""pretending y/n wants to leave the group"" Please 😁 i hope you notice me❤️"
"Let me just tell you this. when 'we lost the summer' came on, *I STARTED SCREAMING MY LUNGS OUT*"
The “ new pink glittery slipper “ killed me 🤣🤣🤣
Unnie can you do an ff that Y/n got in a Car accident ? Or that she gave them a silent treatment? Plzzzz
"I am crying because they are ignoring me i my imagination, i am not kidding, i am really crying"
I'm over here dying over Jin's weapon of choice... glitter pink slippers?! Hahaha 😂🤣
Oh my gosh I am literally a crying mess. I feel like I'm a crybaby now. I never cry and now I do. What is wrong with me? 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Oh God that part of whooping with pink glittery slippers was hilarious
If u underestimate Jin's  glitter pink slippers then that slippers will fly on ur face😌l
Nice fanfiction ..but GOT7 disbanded now💔
POV: when y/n's childhood bestfriend a.k.a Mafia Queen saw each other
"In the end, I almost cried cuz of how it was worded. Will you pls make part two where y/n went out with her friends and did not tell the members."
I love the 8th member Series you're so fantastic . You Are great Autor nim. I appreciate you for that what you are doing you make the best storie Series that i eher read about the 8th member of bts you are the best💜💜💜💜💜
This made my daughter cry she loves bts they are everything to her.
I'm actually a bit too late but still idk why Im a crying mess rn. I think it's cuz of the similarity between my life and this one shot
It literally 4 in the morning and i am crying 😢 😭
Brand new glitter pink slippers HAHAAHAHAHAHAH JIN NEVER FAIL MAKE ME LAUGH🤣🤣🤣
"Author Nim can you make ""When someone propose to you infront of other members_ you as the 8th member"""
This is a masterpiece and I kinda want to cry now 💜
"Can you make a very late 2020 video called "" oppa of the year (you as the 8th member)"" where Y/n chooses the ooty a.k.a oppa of the year award and add got7 😂😄"
It was cute and lovely😘♥️ I loved the screaming part of Jin🤣🤣
Who’s else cries and smiles after reading this. I literally broke down in tears after reading 12:44
Jin and his pink slippers always make's me go crazy!😂😂 Jin's pink slippers are going to make history!🤣
Aww I really want to be a bts member they are so caring and jin his mother sense is the greatest thing in the world
When they forgot y/n birthday and keep scolding her not know it's her birthday and y/n is ignoring bangtan
Hey do you think you could do next episode on 'After they failed the challenge'. I just wanted to see how they would be if y/n hangs out with got7 for a week.. It will be funny.
When y/n hangs out with txt and enhypen.......
Can u make more of these 8th member!       And I must say Jin’s part is the funniest
"I think I would be okay with being whooped by jin's glittery pink slippers , I love that color if you can't tell by my profile"

2:28 J-hope: *screams Malaysia* Me: *shouts cuz I'm in Malaysia*
Haters:you guys aren't friends   Army's: I know right they are not friends because they are family
Suga: we actually all had 6 pack but since is summer the chocolate has melted  I—💀
RM: what's our outfit concept?  Jin: Its all different!  (Camera zooms out and they're all in black)   😂😂..
BTS fan from Philippines Zamboanga city

Jungkook:I would rather die than live without passion.  Suga:everybody jungkook is going to die soon.

I really want them to come back to Malaysia 😭😭😭
"Jk : ""I'd rather die if not able to live with passion "" Suga : jk is going to die fast  Me : suga you're really something 😂😂😂😂😂😂💜💜💜💜💜💜 Cute tho 💜💜😍"
On the RM when where he said “my child mastered Hangul at the age of 4” he meant that when he was a child he mastered Hangul at the age of 4
Kookliet and jimmeo... I'm wheezing 💀
“WHO would marry Super Mario?” -Jin 😂😂😂Why is this so funny?
we want our namjoonie to stay leader and can never be replaced!!!
“I can’t jump from there because I’m old”. Jin we love you no matter how old you get. You will forever be our World Wide Handsome!!!! A symbol of Perfection.
"At 6:30 the proud smile tae has after saying ""damn hot"" 🙈🙈"
9:20 Jin:- **walking on the road with a bag at the back** Me: **remembers and laughs hilariously how he used to carry the bag in  a red shirt and black pant and time travelled**  👀😂😂💜
2:18 Where is this from?😂
"RM might have referred to himself that at the age of 4, he learned hangeul😅"
JK was ready to throw hands over Jiminie being the baby of the group I cried laughing.
RM has a child. I think everyone knows that by now :D
When namjoon brings out his wife and 4children we all should act surprised alright clowns?😃
BTS fan from Rajsthan state of India 💖❤🤗👧
"2:57 they question why the woman would be naked, but not why she would be screaming :/"
jhope is secretly fluent at english .
*Plot twist: Suga is more fluent in English than RM-*
we all know that kookie invented english.
j is for:  jk: JKKK  k is for:  jk: kOoKiE  rm: not everything is about you jungkook
Haters: BTS doesn't know English- Jk: PaRdoN? Jimin: Aahh... ExCusE Me? Jin: HeY sToB iT... Tae: CaN yOu sPeaK mOrE sLusH? J-Hope: oH...yOu ArE vEry nO FuN... Suga: sWaG- RM: YoU goT nO JaMs...
"notice how english didn’t exist until Hobi Said “Everything about that night, was so special” ☀️ 😌🙇🏽‍♀️💜"
Namjoon : BTS wants a Grammy nomination ARMY : then BTS gets a Grammy nomination.
BTS know...... Language: *EXIST* English: *R.I.P*
So I’m conclusion...Suga and J-Hope are secretly fluent in English.
i love how joon encourages them to speak and smiles so fondly when they get the sentences right. best leader <3 they truly improved so much  edit: the fact that i was half asleep while writing this comment hahah thanks yall for all the likes i didnt expect it
J-Hope: Are you happy? Jimin yEs V: 👁👄👁
Video: BTS talking English in tiny Me: they're always tiny
"BTS after getting Grammy nomination be like: I see it,I like it,I want it,I got it😎😎😎😎😎😎😎"
"min yoongi is fluent in english, i dont make the rules"
Jin talking about his song Moon was so cute i'm literally crying...
"They may speak in tiny, but I think we all agree.. *They improved a LOT :')*"
The boys are getting better with English which is great!
Rm: “k” is for.....?  Everyone: Korea       Jungkook:      KOOKIE!!!!!
Jungkook: hot bo-..... Yessssssss👁👁 we know...
_ _*_Our Jungkookie's can say frustrated now_*_ _    _ _*_TRUSFRATED HAS LEFT THE CHAT_*_ _
Therapy is expensive but hearing Bangtan speaking English is *free*
YOU BETTER SAY : NAMJOON BEING DONE WITH THE BOYS FOR 11:00 MINUTE STRAIGHT
I’m waiting for BigHit to say Yoongi is fluent in English. Just like I have been
*BANGTAN SPEAKING ENGLISH IS THE CUTEST THING ON ENTIRE EARTH*
JK : body  RM : what body  JK : hot....  True .....damn true...
BTS speaking or doing things in tiny is literally the CUTEST thing ever! I mean look at these cute adorable human beings!
"Hobi saying ""We want brunchie"" in tiny almost ended me."
"4:41 That ""hAha"" was just so cute :("
am i the only one who loves jimins accent when he speaks english
HOBI IS K*LLING ME WITH HIS CUTENESS HELP IM GENUINELY DEVASTATED
rm: when i first saw him (jk) i was only wearing the underwear. jhope: yeahhh Jimmy: (͡• ͜ʖ ͡•)
JK: Moon MOON. Jin!  * shakes Jin aggressively * *MOON MOON* * shaking Jin aggressively intensifies *
1:06 I swear we really couldn’t be able to survive if Jimin gets fluent.
Her intro is just 🌠iconic🌠
“You will know that liking BTS was the best decision ever” Me: my wallet says otherwise😭
"we all know yoongles is secretly fluent in english, but he’s just, *taehyung voice* “a little shy...”"
The thing that will remain forever funny:     *Hey! Stob it.*
10:30 Does that women know she just sHoOk hands with a sUpEr StAr
suga is def fluent at English-
The Legends Said : -I KNOW HER FACE BUT IDK HER NAME -I KNOW THE MOVIE BUT IDK THE MOVIE NAME
"9:24 *""brunch-ee""*   He's so cute 🥺💜"
*RM : I want a Grammy Nomination... BTS wants a Grammy nomination”*  *”Yoongi : uhhh... go to Grammys”*  YALL GOT WANT YALL WANTED
"BTS speaking in tiny is the ""smollest"" thing 😌💜"
I heard yoongi was improving his English while resting. I can't wait to see how much he learned.
"watching a bts interview is legit a try not to ""uwu"" challenge"
The way Taehyung speaks in English just warms my heart
bts: speaking in english  Joon : *smiles* *like* *a* *proud* *dad* :')
"_ _*_I really can't get over Jungkook ""I'm trending on Twitter, when did I do""_*_ _       _ _*_RM : ""You spoke English""_*_ _"
Jin: we're dance   Namjoon: Love...    Jin: lov-DAFUQ
"""it's massive""           -kim Taehyung 2020."
As a wise man said      Jungkooks English is so cute waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Imagine getting a heart by bunnyswag
The truth untold:            yoongi is an English man😌🤚
the way yoongi is too fluent with his English. He's just shy in this whole time. what a cutie 😭💕
OK BUT J-HOPE’S ENGLISH IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD
10:25 i swear thats why he is our SUNSHINE the wayy he was just so happy over findingg the bagg.. it must have really madee the girlss dayyy
1:15 can we talk how beautiful jin is
am i the only one who loves the intro? <3
every time Yoongi spoke my heart just melted
"THIS WHOLE VIDEO WAS SOOOOOO CUUUUUTTEE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY, WHENEVER HOBI CAME IN THE VIDEO..........My heart skipped a beat.....     I THINK I AM IN.......L-LOVE?"
BUT THEM SPEAKING IN TINY IS TOO CUTE PLEASE😭💖
BTS speaking in tiny is the cutest.
2:18 A mystery for me is if it’s “ur bones so weak” or “u were born so weak”...
No one:  Me: **getting BTS X Maple story ad :)**
they do EVERYTHING in tiny 😔💜
YouTube:0 views Also YouTube: 2 likes
RM: BTS wants Grammy naminaton! Army's: Your wish is our command 😉😉😉
3 things I gotta say.   1: Blonde Jungkook   2: Yoongi is back   3: RM announced they're working on new music
7:57 yes Hobi liking bts was the best decision ive ever made u guys changed my life. A.R.M.Y for ever
Jhope: are u happy Jimin: yes Everyone: 🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀
And maybe Jin's face 😂😩
"_ _*_RM: ""Jungkook English is so cute woah""_*_ _    _ _*_me: ""why you gota expose us like that and make it so accurate""_*_ _ 😂😂"
"Jungkook: I saw RM    Jimmy: ya Jungkook: Ummm I-  and then I thought  Jimmy: what do you think of him Jungkook: He was amazing Joon:  ahhh thank you Joon: you but Jungkook  when I first saw him I was only wearing the underwear Hobi: Yeahhh Joon: l-like in the house! In my home! Joon: And he cam like ""Hiii I'm the new member""  *Confused Jimmy* Joon: y-yeah that was the first impression  *Tae laughing*"
We all know that hobi and yoongi invented english
I'm ready for the BUNNY SWAG💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
1:27 the way jk hold the mic like a baby is Soo cute
Fact : Everyone in bts want to speak English like namjoon.
"*""I'm the moon and army's is my...... Earth""* 😢😢 why he is sooooo cute 💜"
“and jin’s face”    “huh”   BYE- 💀✋
When RM said Jungkook knocked or something and said he was the new member and RM was in his underwear that cracked me up.
Rm be promoting Jin's handsome face when he is not !! 💜 Jin becomes so shy smtimes when speaking in english ㅠㅠ
Who else loves bunny swag :)
me watching the part when namjoon wants a grammy award and then remembering how happy he was when he got a nomination...... AKA...... THROWS PHONE IN EXCITEMENT :)
"I know they're not fluent, but something about their Cute Broken English is what makes me love them even more,ㅋㅋㅋ the way they pronounce English sentences is just so cute! and im just so stunned by Joonie's patients to teach them English carefully so they can be good at it.    we stan the right group Ami's 😊💜💜💜"
So basically Jikook are the tiniest English speakers
"Omg when Hobi said, ""J-Hope how are you? Are you happy?"" And Jimin's little yes! was soo adorablee and Tae's shocked face is such a mood 🤣🤣🤣"
They’re so adorable🥺
I literally started crying hearing jin talk about moon. He is so precious and he works so hard 🥺🥺🥺
"RM: All the 7 members are so CUTE Me,Army and Bunny Swag: FACTS"
"Broo your editing is so good...damn you're talented :(( I'm a hooman who just eats, sleeps and watches BTS :P Love the video btw <33"
"Lol the way nomjoon saracasticaly says ""Maybe, Jin's face"""
Damn the confidence they have I'd never be able to speak another language publicly and that too with a camera shooting me
"jimin said to jungkook ¨you didn't understand him, right?¨ lmao"
Jin: says a single word    Me: * chokes in cuteness *
"Once BTS is fluent in English, all of us Army are going to die because of their hotness and cute"
I love how Namjoon just looks at them proudly and encourages them to talk in english.  Best leader!
"Tae just learned ""it's not in my vocabulary"" to explain that he has nothing else to say but ended up using it in such a savage way LMAO🤣"
"Just 5 seconds ago I looked at bunny swag channel and thought,  "" Ahh it would be nice if a new video gets uploaded . I'm bored now."" And tada came notifications. I'm seriously jungshook!! 😮"
Really yoongi...??? You are fluent  And for hobi I knew it
I therefore conclude ☝️.... Yoongi is secretly fluent in English 😁 💜👏👏👏👏👏
Wouldn't it be so cool if this was like a real series where BLACKPINK and BTS actually did this series

Use star code BLOB to support me when buying robux!
the only kpop i will listen to also can we appreciate hes a bacon hair
"Let this be a reminder for everyone, that he is the first one who made R-POP."
“Let your homework rot”  I felt that
My brother: ew kpop🤢 also my brother: *singing this at the top of his lungs* Me:.... My brother: whAt? its R-POP not KpOp
Someone give him a Grammy award
After watching this I forgot the original Dynamite 🤣🤣
Blue Blob: Walking down Adopt Me with that legendary pet Also Blue Blob: Waking with a dog
This deserves a Grammy
"""Walking down adopt me with that legendary pet"" *Has a common dog*"
blob.
"""So ima dance it off like a bacon hair"" That was so smooth..."
3:13 i like how the uno reverse card dude is dancing on his own when all the others are doing the becky dance lol
Suga: *dies* Suga: *dies again* Me: Bacon Yoongi!
"Lets appreciate the Fact That He Said ""Walking Down Adopt Me With That Legendary Pet"" Without walking Down"
He did it gamers he made R-POP a thing
Me as an army (bts fan): We will all appreciate this in the kpop community <3
I actually thought it was Dynamite - Taio Cruz but it wasn't...
"I really like the part when he says ""WALKING DOWN ADOPT ME WITH THAT LEGENDARY PET"" Which is actually a dog  lol 😆"
나 : 나는 이것을 승인한다  In English: Me:I approve this
“Cause I-I-I’m oofing everywhere” This isn’t dynamite. It’s dienamite.
OH NO THERE COMING ~The stans has entered the chat~
"""No school, Let your homework rot"" This is actually so relatable 😭"
*OOF-NA-NA-NA-NA-NA INTENSIFIES*
me litterally trying to find your song in mm2 radio to have cool songs while shooting killing or surviving
This music should in the R-Pop section.  Buur: My son is growing fast.
"Love the part that goes ""Walking down Adopt Me with a legendary pet"" while he walks witha dog."
"This song is so epic it made me forgot I bought three hairs to combo, instead of using the classic bacon hair"
Me who is half korean: this is high quality content
even duolingo gotta take a dance break from stalking you
"Creative! Dude, YG entertainment should invite you to an audition"
1:07 every gaming students mood
*walking down adopt me with that legendary pet* *shows common dog* Me:yessir
I love how he said “oof” LMaOo 😂 😂 😆 😂
"""log on"" Creating an account ""I oof everywhere"" Albert when he joins paraDIEs life lol"
Blue Blob has 6 copyright claims. To see if I’m right or wrong. Look in the description of all his videos and on 6 of them it says “licenses by YouTube”
this is art.
0:55: Bro what?!- Thats a common dog-
Someone sign him up in one of the Kpop auditions pls 🥺🙏
He's speaking my language now!
Damn he hit the high note with /e dance
that was actually amazing i am shocked of how good that song is!!  Edit: you totally deserve 1 mill subscribers
I love how he says that he's walking down adopt with that legendary pet but it's just a common pet lol
"when the adopt me players see when blue blob says ""walking down adopt me with that legendary pet"" but its a dog  ☢️☢️☢️☢️"
The thing i like about blob is he don't use Autotune which is cool.
This is not originally K-POP but Is made by a K-POP group and is a English song. It’s the most famous K-POP boy group on Billboard and Grammy.
"this is the Orginal bts lyrics    Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight Shoes on, get up in the morn' Cup of milk, let's rock and roll King Kong, kick the drum, rolling on like a Rolling Stone Sing song when I'm walking home Jump up to the top, LeBron Ding dong, call me on my phone Ice tea and a game of ping pong, huh This is getting heavy Can you hear the bass boom?

Hi
"The dislikes are people who asked for a picture but got hit with “important business, sorry!”"
Suga is secretly fluent in English 😎😎😂😂and jin don't have any think😂😂🤣
I personally think Jin’s English accent is cute and honestly he’s pretty good    I think that’s bc he got confidence even when speaking a foreign language
Jhope and his important business is iconic one😂😂
They've all improved their English so much
Jungkook's international playboy is always iconic.😂
"BTS:- taking pictures with Their favourites Meanwhile ARMY:- who want to experience the same thing but can't because of this ""important business"" 😏😏😏"
Jeikei:I want to change my brain to namjuice brain lol
"JK 😂 English tocking is soo quet 😘😂😂 JK 😂 I changed my brain and RM brain 😂😂😂 JHOPE 😂 important business 😂😂😂😂😂 SUGA 😂😂 this chain $3 dollars 😂😂😂 Jin 😂😂 I don't have a friend,s😂😂😂 RM English tocking is soo hord 😂😂 JIMIN 😂😂😂 V 😂😂😂"
Thats guy is very lucky cause jimin got shy suga wanted to make business and jungkook said i like you what the h the lucks smiling at hum
Background: YAEEEAAAHHHH!  Jungkook: Be quiet.
"""you like this? You like this chain? 3 dollars "" will be my all time favorite suga's iconic phrase 🤣🤣"
"There is no end to "" IMPORTANT BUSINESS UUUUUUUU""😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Taehyung ordering McDonald's gets me EVERY TIME. he's so cute
"When Tae says ""sh*tty""🤣"
They all know english..but they nervous to speaking english...bcz they all are fear to mistake their word...
I really like and appreciate that they still try their best to communicate in English when necessary. They are very friendly and nice with foreigners🥺
Aww...Jungkook sounds so cute speaking English. I believe he'll be the next to learn and speak it fluently.
I'm OK because I'm JK.   No one can top that.
Lmao the way Jimin is highkey in love with Tony
Bts fluent english are so cute☺ 😄😆😆😉
I know 'anneyunghaseyo' means hello... right?😅
Jhopes Important Business is going to be continued up to eternity 😅😂💜
Omg jin is so funny
Army: can I take a picture with you?  Hope:sorry important businesseu...       I don't have think to say....
Jin's reaction of 250M views was the best😅😂💜
Oooooooooooo jk's english is soooooo cute 😍😘
4:40 killed me. So cute. Jk is the man
Suga: .. Enjoyeeeeee  Me : how cute💜💜💜
"To be honest, First time i heard that ""Important BTS"" instead Hoba's ""Important Businesseu""🤭"
No one: Literally no one: But J-Hope: english speaku
"Great 💡I think I am going to use the  ""Importance bisinezz"" too from now😏"
4:20 - 40:28 ain't that everyone's wish
Think bts Is ur country and jin asking u know bts ?  Me be like - 👁👄👁
MY NAME IS JUNGKOOK INTERNATIONAL PLAY BOY😎😎  ME:I KNOW WHAT HES TRYING TO SAY HES A GAMER NOT A PLAY BOY XD ARMY AND ME:*SUPPORTS JUNGKOOK TRYING TO SAY* HATERS: HAHAHHA PLAY BOY BOOO ME AND ARMY TO HATERS:😠😠😠😠 HATERS: *RUN!!!*
Am I the only one having a second hand embarrassment. 😂
Suga is actually better in English ❤️🔥
Very very important businessu 😜😜😜😜
Cutest video ever
Suga when he pulled down his glasses
Hey Yo~ international playboy
Where is the first clip from
Where can I watch the full episode of the first scene
😂😂😂i don't think English is hard to learn they just need to know some basics
They can learn English ☺☺😆😆😆😇😃
5:26  Lmao 😂
😄😄😆
😘😘🤗🤗😘🤗
Hard to say they are straight
first video see where?
I know her face  but dont know her  name  I know movie but don't know movie name
Ok it's bery bery funny....but really why they can't take picture with fans while thry filming to own camera?
wow

"Merhaba düşmüşler. , jsfjf bir"

Happy birthday Mynance!
Wow! this was amazing! I loved it!💞💞💞💞💞💞💞 Good job👍
"*Hey Mynance, please, upload more BTS videos:*  *DNA 🧬* *Dynamite 🧨*"
"I love ON music, and I love the Sonic gang,, ❣️❣️💓💓"
Amazing Job!<333
"Missed the Premiere, but im still into this."
Wow this was awesome. Happy Birthday Mynance👍
"This is so so soo beautiful and what a wonderful song and I like sonic when he sing,s and dance."
FOR NEXT VIDEOS PLEASE: 1. DYNAMITE(BTS)  2. LIFE GOES ON(BTS)  3. TEMPO(EXO) 4. LOTTO(EXO) 5. GOOD GUY(SF9) I LOVE THIS VIDEO😍
"I may have missed the premiere this time but I can assure you I still watched this video, or rather a beautiful animation. 😉  I love the stunning backgrounds used here (and I also spy a few Legend of Zelda setting) and they fit perfectly for the music video. I kinda wish Knuckles and Tails to have lines here though since they're main characters as well from the Sonic franchise. Regardless of that, I love that part when Gadget's glasses slowly fell to his eyes and when Cream made her cameo appearance (I want to see more of her in future MMDs *cough cough* as Sana from Twice 🤭).  So yeah, another masterpiece of animation this is and it was a really nice one being the first video of the year. Looking forward to more amazing animations! Lastly, I'm going to greet you with a Happy, Happy Birthday. Stay cool! UwU"
"This is so so soo beautiful and what a wonderful song and I like sonic when he sing,s and dance."
"The lighting and the environments are so nice looking!! I’m so happy this exists, I purple you man! 💜"
"This is so beautiful. I feel that I can almost be touched by Sonic's own thoughts, emotions and dreams."
omg mynance cuando vi el estreno me puse como *gritos fangirl* x3 me encanto este es un buen trabajo un tiempo bien invertido y me encanta on y en la parte cuando canta sonic x3 el agudo de jimin x3
Happy late birthday Mynance! And great job on making this. I love it! ❤️ I’m an army. Keep making more! Fighting! ✊🏻💜

3:09 Rm looks so done 😭
And manager Sejin is so used to them being kids. He's just there sitting and scratching his arm while watching the kids play.
3:10 if Namjoon was looking at me like that I would've died right there and then PERIODT
4:42  jimin:   * laughing knowing he couldnt live with out him *
Thats called the life....forget what you are ....just enjoy the every moment of life.... Just enjoy.... 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜👑😍I love BTS from the bottom of my HEART for not only there songs but also what are they in real.... The pure soul of Angel😇
They are billionaires but still happy for free ramen 😂😂😂😂😂
I love it when Taehyung was in his interview and in the middle of interview Hobi comes into frame. And he smiles and waves at the camera. He's such a cutie. I love it when Jungkook took food from the pantry and it was for trainees from I Land. I love it when Taehyung gave 1 second previews of his mixtape on V Live. Oh he probably got in big trouble with the staff. All and all I love seeing guys act like normal people. How would like only working and you don't get to take a break from work? Would you like that? I would like to balance work and play.
Kim Namjoon💜👑 Kim Seokjin💜👑 Min Yoongi💜👑 Jung Hoseok 💜👑 Park Jimin💜👑 Kim Taehyung 💜👑 Jeon Jungkook 💜👑 BTS 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜  BTS 💜 ARMY forever

Wow!!!! JK looks like real detective
First! 💜💜💜
I forgot that rules  I just laugh in the whole video lmao 😂😂🤣🤣
1:01 and the battle starts here
I lost in the first clip only😂😂😂it really is hard💜🤣
i know it will take a lot more than this but i want to start a trending hashtag saying #letkpopidolsdate  in order for companies to change fans need too idols are people and sacrifice space privacy love and not to mention starving themselves to fit the image this is just one thing but it is a start no matter who it is regardless of gender beauty or status as long as our idols smile that should be enough
sorry but i didn't pass the challenge 😂😂 can't stop laughing and smiling because of them 😂😂
Oh me! I definitely passed😅....*I don't even sound convincing to myself*😂😂😂😂
how can I play this? I always smile when I see them. impossible game...
Am I the only person who can't control my laughter even if it's a simple joke?
Bts    RM - our  cute leader     Jin - our WWH      Suga -  our cute meaow 🥰     J -hope - our sunshine     Jimin - our  mochi  .  v - our tiger 🐯🐯     Jungkook  - our cute bunny  🐇🐰

Run editors are smart. They never failed to make us laugh.
"Laughter is an amazing medicine & this is why I watch ""try not to laugh"" videos...because I'm guaranteed a good laugh. Sure, than means I lose....but I still say I win because the laughter brings me joy. 😉💜"
Jimmin love police Suga

The first clip got me. GG immediately. PS: How not to laugh when you are posting a bunch of crack-heads going through their chaotic daily lives?

*Jimin* ngủ từ tóc thẳng thành tóc xoắn mà vẫn còn ngủ!
Chắc do lịch trình dày quá nên hk ngủ được nhiều  Nhìn mấy ổng ngủ vừa xót mà vừa cưng
BTS-thở thôi cũng khiến mấy chị em ARMY dãy đành đạch :))
Cái hình nền bảo bối cưng thế này còn thêm em chimmy cute thế kia  thì sao kiềm lòng nổi mà k vào xem đây chứ????!!!!! cục MoChi à ngủ thôi mà cái mặt cưng chịu k nổi!!!
Mochi PARK JiMin cưng ghê
Ad chăm thật
Một điểm rất thích ở ad đó là rất chăm nha
"yêu quá mừ tui cgx bt là BTS có lịch trình dày đặc nên ngủ rất ít xót lắm nhưng cũng yêu lém tui thik ad đó nha,chăm ra video ghia lun"
I love you taehyung~aaa  Yes from Indonesia
"Chăm quá ad ơi, chắc chắn sẽ thành công nà!"
"mấy ổng ngủ nhìn bình yên quá lun ý (*///*) mà hầu hết đều thấy ngủ vì mệt thoi, tội ghê á TT Thoi thì cũng chúc mấy anh tận hưởng thanh xuân này một cách trọn vẹn và healthy nhất!!! Army thưng các anh nhìu (>///<)"
2:49 Su kiểu: cà phê...cà phê đâu...mang ra...mang r...zzzzzzzzzz
Jimin ngủ cưng thế 😢
Tae ngủ dễ thương quá Mấy ổng cứ đụng đâu là ngủ đó à. Thương gì đâu á
3:37 đừng gọi Yoongi là cụ ple=)

J-HOPE của em dễ thương thật sự luôn ý 🤤
"Good night BTS, các anh đã có một ngày dài rồi bây giờ đã đến lúc nghỉ ngơi, mong rằng các anh sẽ có một giấc ngủ ngon :-)😊😊😊"
Ad chăm thật
"Vid dễ thương quá😂❤ nhưng 3:38 Ad lưu ý đừng gọi Suga là ""cụ"" nha vì anh ấy ko thích bị gọi như thế😅"
"Nhìn các anh ngủ thôi cũng hạnh phúc lắm rồi. Lịch trình bận nên bất chấp không gian, thời gian chỉ cần nhắm mắt là vào mộng luôn. Cưng xỉu"
Ad ra video nhanh thật đấy
💜💜So cute
เรารักแบทพิ้งบีทีเอสจ้าชอบจ้า
"Nhìn lúc nhìn mấy ảnh ngủ gật thương lắm, lúc đó chỉ muốn lại đó ôm mn vào lòng và chúc họ ngủ ngon 😊"

Nếu mà nói thì ad chỉ mới làm vài video thôi mà cái nào cx chất lượng cả😍😍😍
đáng yêu xỉu
Đa số những lần ngủ đều là tại nơi làm việc  hoặc ở trên máy bay xe di chuyển ít có ở nhà thì cũng hiểu đc bts đã làm việc chăm chỉ như thế nào để mới có được ví trí như giờ 💯
Vừa cưng vừa xót. Mong rằng  mấy ah có nhiều thời gian nghỉ ngơi hơn
—_– 🐰💛💛💛💛
V là tuyệt tác... tui là tui fan nhà kế mà tui mê V cực
"Nhìn các anh ngủ mà thương ghê,các anh đã làm vc rất mệt mỏi đến thời gian ngủ cx ko có đủ nên ms ngủ ở mọi nơi như thế,."

Jungkook doesn't belong to anyone but himself. It's not their concern if Jungkook has so many tattoos.
"he's now matured, he can do whatever he wants. let him be."
"Jungkook is literally an adult.  He can do whatever he wants, if you don't like it, then that's your problem,  not his"
while us international armies are thirsting over his tattoos and want him to reveal more....
Bro I fuck with jungkooks tattoo hope he doesn’t hide under his sleeve all the time
He’s an adult and he can do whatever he wants to HIS body. He doesn’t belong to anyone but himself  so if he wants to get tattoos then let him be .
It doesn’t matter if fans can’t understand what the tattoos mean. They’re supposed to be personal messages. It only matters that Jungkook knows what the tattoos mean and that he likes them. It’s his body at the end of the day.
When will these ARMYS realize that JK doesn't need their permission. Who cares if he has tattoos? Some ARMYS really have the audacity to think that they own JK.
Wdym “I want him to stop there” he’s not y’all damn child tf
Jungkook says he wants to be himself this years that’s what he’s doing get used to it people
"it’s HIS tattoos. he can do whatever he wants to his body. it’s his body, NOT YOURS."
Just a thought: maybe fans who don't want BTS members to be hurt by malicious comments shouldn't contribute malicious and hurtful comments about BTS members.
Jungkook is jungkook. Let him do what he wants to HIS body it’s JUNGKOOK’s body not yours. He’s an adult. It’s his life anyways not yours so try to mind your own business NOT others. And why are you even saying that your a “fAn” if you were a real fan you would’ve always supported him!  Thank you so much for the likes
Good for Jungkook!  I’m glad he is doing what he likes. This is probably another reason he stays off of social media a lot. He doesn’t want to see or hear the negativity!  Don’t blame him!
"First of all, JK can do whatever he wants on HIS own Body. Second: His Tattoos are beautiful and match him very well. Hey Jungkook, you nice, keep going. 🤍💜"
"jeongguk literally had the first tattoo for ages before the other, he’s such a wholesome person so leave him to have the bodyart he likes"
"Jungkook: *""Can I live? Can I f**king LIVE? Why yall always gotta mess with me?""*"
He looks so badass with those tattoos. Sexier than ever
Simpers for jungkook be like: it’s his body so he can be hot!  Me:  uhmmm what is wrong with you simps-
"I don't even stan bts but this is just childish. It is his body, his life, his decision."
THOSE WHO WANTED HIM TO REMOVE AND DIDN'T LIKE HIS TATTOOS   THEY ARE NOT EVEN ARMY BYE
Jungkook isn't a little kid anymore he's a matured man he can do what he wants
"“Army’s” that were embarrassed ARE NOT ARMY’S,If they were they wouldn’t have a problem with Jungkook doing what HE WANTS to HIS OWN BODY."
"I don’t get why this lil kids controlling jung kook’s life, he is a an adult , he can control his own life not yours."
Jungkook can do with his body watever he wants he doesn't need a permission from anyone
JUNGKOOK’S TATTOOS LOOKS SO HOT ON HIM
It's specially JK..  He can literally do anything and everything... If you love him let him be in peace with his beautiful tattoos
Kook literally chopped some food and got hate for his arm drawing 🚶
honestly jungkook's tattoos are such an integral part of him now i can't even imagine seeing him without his beautiful tattoos
"I want to just show off his tattoos like a normal person and not have to wear long sleeves al, the tkme"
I mean I don't like tattoos but this is Jk's life like wtf
GIVE THIS MAN FREEDOM TO DO WHAT HE WANTS AAAAA HE’S SO HOT WITH TATTOOS
"Why do they want him to remove it, it’s his body and he can do whatever he wants with his body , it look so good on him , if the manager and the members did not say anything we don’t have to and jimin also have tattoos but not on his arm and people not saying anything much like they are doing jungkook leave him alone (sorry if I am saying it harshly but it’s what I am thinking about) I purple all of you 💜💜💜"
"He’s an adult and he can do whatever he wants to HIS body. He doesn’t belong to anyone but himself  so if he wants to get tattoos then let him be . none of these are ""new"" he just never showed them to us because of people who are judgmental, if you don't like them be quiet and don't look. you wonder why hes always wearing huge clothes to cover them because people always got something to say.  Most ARMYS loved them and we beg him to see more and when he finally feels confident enough to show them and they're not blurred out people make it negative"
Y’all trippin- the tattoo is fire af💀✋🏽
He is an adult he can do whatever he wants PLUS he blessed us with the new tattoos
"Like it’s even possible, but he looks even hotter with his new tattoos. 💜💜💜he wants more tattoos then he gets it, none of our or your bussiness. Jungkook our golden maknae can do whatever he likes!!"
Me: *hoping he gets more tattoos 🥺*
"Jungkook is a grown MAN. Just because he is Korean, or an idol, does not mean he is not allowed to get tattoos or do what he wants. You should appreciate him for who he is and not hate on him just because he has tattoos."
"Its so cool how we get to see a new tattoo once in a while,jungkook has always been artistic and it looks so good on him.Hope he knows that its his body and its not his job to give a shit if some people dont like it on his body."
JK tattoos is really scary... Yoongi Don't have tattoos only...
"If army will continue hindering Jungkook from doing what he wants, what he might regret in the future is being inked “ARMY” on his hands"
I srsly saw the same video but instead it says that i-armys are judging his new tattoo. Whoever it is it's his body NOT ours.
Jungkook's eye tattoo can represent anything it's not just the triangle! 🤦🏻‍♀️  Edit: I didn't expect this comment to have 913 likes thanks so much but yeah Jungkook is all grown up now it's his choice.
"4:02 ""Jungkook, the youngest member of BTS, seems to be living the way he wants""  AS HE SHOULD!!"
"Ahh, anytime BTS does something to break stereotypes, there’s always some ‘fans’ ready to tell them to stop and change..."
seriously?!? regret it later?? pft jungkook is a really mature guy and very sensible he would never get someting on his body without any meaning behind it. I TRUST HIM AND IN BTS💜
Our kookie have his own choice....its his money and his body he can do any thing....💜💜💜He is not a child any more he can leave his life like an adult........
if your a real army you won’t mind him having a tattoo.
In episodes the editors have always blurred out his sleeve. So I’m surprised they didn’t do so in that episode. I personally love his tattoos and I love how he wants to show them off💜💜
"""Jungkook,the youngest member of BTS, seems to be living the way he wants"" AS HE SHOULD !!  He is an adult and he can do whatever he wants with his body and if you are a real fan then you should accept his decision 🙂🙂🙂  True ARMYs love BTS with tattoos or without them 🤠🤠🤠"
As jungkook said before if armys really love him they'll accept and love him for him 💜
we love u jungkook ur tattoos are beautiful!! please dont listen about what so-called fans say its ur life live it the way u want 💗💗💗
Jungkook is old enough do whatever he’s a grown man let him live.  Edit: not me getting 214 likes 🥺✌🏻
Oh God. And here I am praying for that day to come sooner when he reveals all of his beautiful body tattoos. These few ARMYS 🤦🤦🤦
It's so cool like jk was so young back then now he's really matured
"The eye reminds me of Tokyo Ghoul haha.  I love his tattoos, not because I, myself, like the designs but because I like that HE is clearly happy with them and HE loves them!"
Real army will support no matter what bts do. Keep doing what makes you happy jungkook we still love you❤️
This is exactly why he barely show his tattoos.He is a grown man he can do whatever he like I don’t understand why it’s such a big deal.
I’m proud of him period and I don’t know if I was one of the only ones that thought this but i felt like he would get more tattoos because he loves being himself he’s being him that’s all you could hope for his happiness and well being at the end of the day army is going to be army and support the boys whatever way they choose
I’m not a part of the fan base but this came up on recommended videos for me and I just gotta say it’s HIS body let him do what he wants. I honestly think they’re pretty cool!
Jungkook can do anything with his body because it's his body.Jungkook don't worry you can do anything with your body nobody will bother you but please don't harm yourself.
He’s grown. An adult. He doesn’t owe anyone anything and he doesn’t even owe an explanation for his tattoos. I hope he continues to be happy and never stops being himself for anyone. If you’re a real ARMY you will always support him and any of the guys as long as they are being good people.
"""K-armies are embarrassed"".Jungkook didn't crime why people overreacting 😭let him live as he wants"
"😂😂😂 Jungkook has step into the tattoo loop where once you get one tattoo, you’ll only want more."
Jungkook can do whatever he want+the tattoo are amazing😍
"yo everytime an idol gets a tattoo i get so happy, cause like.  tattoos are cool. 🤧"
"I want jungkook to have tattoos on his other arm. Now, that's sexy"
Why would he remove his tattoos......Stop acting like his parents🤦
I saw the episode and I  literally was so happy that the company atleast didnt blur out the tattoos and let him be  comfortable not hiding those  On the funny side I  thought that people would be dying looking at those tattoos but I was surprised that how are they judging him like that  It's HIS body and he could do whatever he wants to do and many armys know that he had said once if army loves him that wont mind his tattoos ........
jungkook is the reason why i started admiring people with tattoos
Its HIS body and HIS choices. I personally love his tattoos
Guys ik you guys are worried but JK has something called a brain he has been in the strict idol community for years he knows what he is doing and it's his body and he can do what he wants on it so let's just appreciate it and keep stanning BTS forever 0t7 forever
"Some fans seem to forget Jungkook is not a ""baby"" anymore. He's 23, old enough to get tattoos and even drink. C'mon now"
"I can't wait for JK to be covered in tattoos (if thats what he wishes to do). Idols getting tattoos is powerful imo. Korea need a huge shift when it comes to tattooing. They need to make it legal, then tattoo artist can practice safely, and without fear."
I get that Jungkook is an adult and he can do whatever he wants to HIS body. And don’t get me wrong that tattoo is AWSOME......It’s just unexpected that’s all
"Idk why but I get 🛐CHILLS🛐 when I see someone with tattoos, and IF IT'S ON ✨JUNGKOOK✨ omfg I might just die soon"
"Those bashers have ruined their lives because of jealousy, so they are also ruining the lives of others."
I love the fact that Jungkook is living the way he wants.
"a lot of korean armys are embarrassing us, me, a lot of other korean armys. i’m upset with my fellow k-armys. it’s his own life and body."
My boy is grown up nowwwwww.... So let him do anything he wants.. because he is not your slave..... Love uuuuu JK ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"It’s his life he can do whatever he wants and if he wants to add even more tattoos I’m so here for it, I support him no matter what decisions he’s going to make in his life 🖤🖤"
"yeah, like most people said. This dude is GROWN. He doesn't have to answer for his OWN body. Seriously if you're not happy with what makes him happy then you're not a fan"
Dear jungkook oppa I will support you in your every decision till my last breath 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Jk can do whatever he wishes to do on his body ..we ARMYS love him always 💜💜💜💜
"We are just maybe so used to seeing him as our cute little golden maknae, but he's all grown up now...even if his body will be covered by tattoos, you haters cannot deny the fact that this man is extremely talented... So let him be!"
i love tattoos and im a kook stan leave him to do what he wants
The man can't even pull up his shirt sleeve without someone scolding him like a child. Some people think too much of themselves to think they know whats best for him. Like he can' think for himself.
None of the BTS members are show-offs. They’re human beings. With choices and a life. We need to protect them and many other K-POP artists because there are many who just hate K-POP or that one idol in general .They need their freedom like all of us.
"At the end of the day, Jungkook is a GROWN MAN, he is his own person and fans need to stay in their place. The man is fine."
Let him have the amount of tattoos that he wants🙄 some armys need to mind their own business let him be tf 🙄 it gets me so angry that people want to control them like who are you 🤦🏻‍♀️
Our jungkokie can do what ever he wants.. we support him.. if that makes him happy.. we dont own him.. true army think this way💜💜 we love you jk and stay healthy
"He’s not your son,let him do whatever he wants."
"His life, his OWN body, his decision."
"It's his body, it's his life  he can do whatever he wants already he sacrifice many things for army's  🥺🥺🥺   I  am from  India   and I loved  his tatoo 😘😘"
"“jungkook should show his tattoo more”  people go on saying shit about his tattoos and wonder why he hardly show them, he gets it for himself, not for you guys."
"I love eyes and draw them all the time, especially when doodling. He’s an adult and it’s his body. It’s no one else’s place to judge him or tell him what to do. I would love to see his full sleeve."
We need to stop treating idols like rag dolls and start treating them as human
I love jungkooks tattoos. I would really love to see pictures of the whole sleeve if he ever decided to share them one day 🤗
Oh god he's an adult! He can do what he wants with his body. Honestly I feel embarrassed for those armys who don't support him. I love his tattoos and I want him to be free to show them 💜
All are jealous of Yeontan😥😶
"I like the way he introduce to yeontan like,""meet the four legs member"" yeontan"
No one Literally no one  Yeontan : Millions of girls are jealous of me 😎😎
Tannie don't know how lucky he is🥰🥰
"Yeontan aka one of the most luckiest dogs In the world Then there's Mickey, holly,.."
Me searching about army on google. Google : *The only fandom that wants a pomeranian dog to appear on stage as one of the members of BTS.*
Tooo jealous  of yeontan (but  he is adorable)
Me before the video starts: Its yeontan duh
There are no army's without knowing yeontan😎
He is the most luckiest living being on earth
Sooooo lucky!💖 Jimin kissed him😚 Jungkook playing with him💫
I am very jealous 😏
The 9th is Suga's Min holly  And 10th is Hobi's Mickey
KIM NAMJOON KIM SEOKJIN MIN YOONGI JUNG HOSEOK PARK JIMIN KIM TAEHYUNG KIM YEONTAN JEON JUNGKOOK !!! BTS!!!
When a dog is life is better than yours: *sO tHiS iS mY dEsTiNy RiGhT?!*
"And already practicing ""did you see my bag"" dance with J-Hope"
Lmao but I thought it was gonna be that one interview dude who Jin told him he needed to get pink hair.
I wouldn't be surprised to see our Tannie as the 8th member of BTS..... 💜
"*Things that are relatable between me and BTS*   *Namjoon -* _Hates to eat seafood but loves them_ _I get shy when acting cute and covers my mouth with my hands_ 🤭  *Jin -* _Scolds when I’m mad_ _literally the mom of the group_   *Yoongi -* _I’m an introvert like Yoongi, also I’m an old grandma_ 😂 _I can be innocent but when someone gets me mad they are done_ 💀  *Hobi -* _we are both crackheads, laughs out loud like him, laughs at everything that’s not even funny, loves dancing_ 🦄  *Jimin -* _When laughing my eyes ARE GONE_   *Taehyung -* _TaeTae has yeontan, and that’s my favourite breed if I had a dog_ (idk how to spell it :,)   *JK -* _LOVES BANANA MILK_"

Tetapi akhir kan taehyung banyak berubah kan .. pasti kalian army tau itu ,dan itu sangat berdampak pada kita ,dampaknya antara senang atau sedih nya tuhh ada kan, sedih nya taee lebih pendiam , jarang sekali terlihat senyuman kotaknya yg khas ,tertawa aja kurang lepas gituu, yaa aku disitu selalu kepikiran apa yg terjadi pada awalnya , dampak positif nya tae yg sekarang lebih.. dewasa dengan sifat yg cool nya ,keren makin ganteng yaa bunn hehe:) , yaa aku bersyukur banget akan perubahan positif nyaa ,tapi aku kurang nyaman dan khawatir dgn tae yg sekarang:(, tetapi apalah daya aku cuman army modal kuota aja ke konser nya aja belom kesampean ,apa lagi dgn   berubah nya sifatnya tae oppa saat ini aku selalu berdoa agar tae-oppa selalu bahagia , terimakasih atas yg baca curhatan aku yg gk jelas ini , sarang Heo❤"

JHOPE is ok if his girlfriend doesn't speak Korean as he will work hard to learn her language
“he prefers pale skin” bye y’all 🏃🏾‍♀️💨💨
RM's ideal type's age = 1991-1999  Me being born in 2003= hehe I am not gonna cry I am not gonna cry
"""he likes pale skin and long straight hair"" you better mean asian girls namjoon.."
I laughed so hard when it said he doesn't like cleavage like the heck
"Me when it comes to age ,weight,singing *Loses shit*"
You know it’s fine I already know I’ll never meet any of their ideal types Why? Because: 1. I’m African American  2. I’m not skinny 3. I’m 174cm 4. I can barley speak my own native language 5. I’m not into makeup or a girly girly
Dude his standards are really high
Sorry but when did Namjoon ever say these things 💀
I'm black so l'm gonna take my leave🚶🏿‍♀️
When the only requirement you fit is the english part😭
When you are perfect for him.But when it comes to the age😐😐
I can never match his standards 😂😂😂
Bruh namjoon is a hard type but hobi is a really good type hobi want a smart bgirl
I never knew his standards were so high 😭
SUGA is ok with long distance relationship
Me black: alright imma head out
"When you are his ideal type,but two things rushes everything😣"
Namjoon preference...... Me... 1 no eye charms i have fucking dark circles 2.. age.. iam 2002 born 3.. height not at all.. im a short potato of 148 cm height
Namjoon Favourite Clothes in a girl are: •Red High Converse Me: *Plays converse high by BTS*
as a goth born in 2005 i know he won’t ever love me buT hey it’s worth a shot
"It’s relaxing watching your videos after a long week of school and homework~ TwT  I don’t match with Nam’s preference u.u But it’s ok, someone deserves his beautiful smile and I can’t be, but he seems like an amazing friend ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ"
Expensive ideal type..hehehe..😂
There are similarities in me and RM oppa  Have pale skin  Love reading Love taking selfis Know English  But born in 2004  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
"I don't smoke at all, speak English and learning Korean, can sing and known lyrics too"
50 KILOGRAMS. JEESUSSSS
Ok I have long straight hair and I can speak English but that's all....🙂🥲
Me everything is perfect EXEPT the age and that singing part😅 Im not gonna cry guys😫
The weight and I have a natural skin tone. That's it. 🥺❤
"rm: likes pale skin and does not like cleaveage. Me: is black and have boobs that can turn most t-shirts and tanks into...well lets just say, I constantly have to  pull a lot of my shirts up. Also has no problem showing off my cleavage. ""well shit"""
Me being black with 4c hair ... 🚶
I don’t smoke or go to clubs and I love to read and that’s the only things that describe me 🥲 goodbye soulmate joonie
I really appreciate the efforts that you put into this video.
"lol, when you have all of this BUT STILLL YOU WILL NEVER DATE HIM, my heartu [*]"
I'm so similar to RM  he sounds like a wonderful person to date 💗💗💗💗😭😭
The idea that he is my bias and i match all the feature but he well never know me!
Jhope is ok...with the language ..
Namjoon😎😘
"I think the army , who will be rm girlfriend , she loves rm for his heart and for his support words"
In short he likes intelligent and pretty girl who is calm and well mannered
I have matched suga's ideal type!
Yay!!! You took my request. YEEEE.......😘😘😘😘😘
Rm's I deal type age is 1993-1999 Me:My hearteu boom boom 😭😭 But I will be happy for the girl who will be perfect for rm💗 even though my heart will pain but it's his choice and my wish before his marriage is... Becoming his friend lil sis lol
I match everysingle standard except that I am hijabi so I can't wear shorts and you can't see my hair joon 🙂🙂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭
1st I really wanna know who's this 1 person who dislikes this video??? It clearly shows this video is about Ideal type of Mr. Namjoon.. Then what's the meaning of dislike???  Huhhhh!!!! 🤔😤 Anyways the video have been presented perfectly.. It's really very sweet & informative.. 😊🌸💜However what if I almost match 80% of these criterias.. Mr. Namjoon will never gonna know that I exist in this world.. Hehehehe 😇🌼
When u realise that u only 12 years younger than him
"well I match almost all of them except weight and more importantly not living in korea, the make up one is soo funny! 😂😂"
"Wow, the guy knows exactly what he wants. Major respect dude. Even I don't know what I want and my type keeps changing! I hope whoever they are you're able to meet them soon~.   I will make a shameless request though and ask that they be bada** in their own way. I can just see the shenanigans that the both of you would get into if they were! XD"
My prefence matched with jimin. But unfortunately I cant speak Korean. So I am learning it btw.
When you came too early 😔😔
Nobody : Sister: why are you watching this  Me : to get heartbroken 😭  No Seriously I have been laughing the whole time cuz am nothing he said now Excuse me I need to go and die under a rock or probably go watch a ff
"The only part of his ideal type that I am is that I am not famous, loves music and is pale sorry I smoke and drink way too much, I’m also not relaxed or calm hahah  Not that I ever will meet him"
Thanks for this video!
Λοιπόν θα ήθελα να πω κάτι πάνω σε αυτό. Όταν ερωτεύεσαι κάποιον δεν έχει σημασία από πού ειναι πόσο ύψος ή κιλά έχει απλά θα ερωτευτείς αυτόν τον άνθρωπο και θα αγαπάς τα πάντα επάνω του .και δεν σημαίνουν τίποτα τα ideal types
"I dont know who my bias is. I figured it might be RM because of how unique he looked. I'm quite older than they are. But I like to watch these out of curiosity.  I matched all the way up to putting myself 2nd and others 1st, I believe. He might totally dig my eyes. My physical attributes don't match his expectations at all (6ft, tanned, heavier athletic body type, frizzy hair, trouble skin, etc.) I haven't been able to check others preferences. However I'm almost certain the result would be quite similar. I'm the odd one out.   My next investigation would be Jin.  Thanks for the video, this was informative."
"Y'all I think these are not real because. I don't think he would defeat all this, to be honest, they don't really have a problem dating outside the race or with the skin colors or what kind of hair they have. I think all this is not true."
I think we all know Namjoon would very much enjoy cleavage hahaha 😏😏😏
"I’m all of these except for the long straight hair, it’s curly and it was long lol but I cut it😂😂"
He prefers pailer skin. Me: Crying while staring at my brown skin
They haven’t been interviewed or asked about their ideal type in 2021 so this not accurate 😕
"Love him so much but he actually does have quite high standards. I think I'd match most of his preferences but never good enough if that makes sense 😪 On top of that I'm 3 years younger, 2 cm taller and weight around 2 kg more than he'd prefere but regardles of that it's hopeless eitherways because I won't ever meet him in my life 😭💔"
Plot twist: Namjoon is already married
I want to be his wife cuz I like him about 1 year and a day never goes think about him  O! Namjoon I really like you
Hold up! He doesn’t like clevage?! Ahah did he actually said that? 😂😂
“when it comes to weight he wants idleast 50kg”      me: *HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO BE THE WEIGHT OF A 12 YEAR OLD IM LOST-*
"Age, skin color and weight doesn't matches ... 😭"
I perfectly matched with his ideal type but age. But he said age doesn't matter to him right but he is okey with long distance relationship even Google also show that and language he is okeyy with English language
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Still cracks me up that the fans actually believes that any of this is true. 😂
🤗🤗🤗
"Rosé from Blackpink suites his ideal type the best,,,I mean she is sweet and feminine and at the same time she is smart and sexy.... It would be fun to see RM and Rosé have a English conversation.. Wouldn't it be??? This is just my opinion guys, I am not shipping them...No hate pls"
04:55 Under the sea~~
I think I’m really his type lol
Please help What is the name of the app used for this video Please 😭😭😭😭 I really need it
When everything is Okey but... When your born in 2006. 😩
Me: crying in curly
What's wrong in long distance relationship??🤔
I matched all of them except for the heights :)
"I can't sing,and I'm 2000😫😫"
6:42 J-Hope
I love it
When you are born in 2001😭
Good luck girls😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
I'm 60kgs .. so I don't fit in.. ok bye
Bt tell me who is that BTS member who is ok with long distance relationship?
Up til 50 kg. Damnit
Nothing but haven't you listen opposite poles attract each other
170 cm and 50kg??????

Yoooo his type is Cardi B no cap 👀
Orange nail polish .......
Ok the only thing is age and iam 2cm higher than 170 lol but thats no difference
Can sm1 tell me what a selca is?
Lost me at long straight hair
What does mean Selcas?
"RM saying he wants a girl with white pale skin , its sounds racist why does color of skin matter to him 🤔  He always says race and skin color doesn't matter but now finding this out skin color does matter to him. I love all the members but RM type  sounds like a idol not a regular women who is not famous"
Rose blackpink
1993 Yess I'm in

"""My mom told me she adopted me from under a bridge""  TOP 10 Asian Parents Lies 💯"
JK-'My mom hit on him first.' No wonder he inherited his dad's attitude of staying away from girls along with his looks.😂
I laughed like a crazy when SUGA said that his mom said he is looking like a boiled dumpling 😂
"Suga: we are going over to a bridge   suga: ""my mom told me she adopted me from under a bridge"" And again ""i am going to my birthplace"" That part was really funny.....our  Yoongi---the savage boy😂😂👌👍 I am literally dying😂😂😂"
Tae: My mom learned how to cook with your shows...May I have your autograph- BTS: Dying 😂 Armys: Also dying 😂 Mr. Baek be like: Da fuq?
"Whenever yoongi covers his mouth in fake shock like that, I can’t stop laughing😭😭"
Why am I not surprised that Jin burnt chocolate and got scolded😭😭
0:00 - 0:26     Tae : My mom learned how to cook with your shows . MAY I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH?  Rm : My mom told me not to come back home without your autograph .  Me : 👁👄👁
"V: jiminie is a very innocent boy,hes so kindhearted jin: then would u really introduced him to ur sister V: NO WAY😅😄  BTS: its understandable🤣🤣"
V: Jimin  is a very nice and innocent boy Me: the way he be killing armies I don’t think he is💀🤚🏽
The thing when I laughed like a horse is when yoongi said that my mom adopted under the bridge I'm going to my birth Place🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Suga's mom is savage just like him
Hobi: I'll introduce my noona to JK JM: that's illegal. she will be handcuffs  😅😅😅🤣🤣
Now we. Know. Why yoongi like that his mum is so savage!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
suga telling his mom told he looks like a boiled dumpling.....😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
2:29 suga is like i dont care about my mom she said i was adopted 😂😂😂😂
Comment me J-hope fans I want to see how many J-hope fans are here do u all fans know J-hope don't got any fans letter he always criyed that he doesn't got any fan letter so please J-hope fans send letters to him ... .
""" I really like my mom so I hope my girlfriend is like my mom""  Yeah, I can do that"
I swear Suga Savageness has came from his Mother 😂😂😂.... I wish I could meet his Mother 🙁💜💜💜💜💜... ILYSM Aunt thanks for giving us a Human Cuttest 🐈Boy 😃💜💜....
yoongi's mom wakes up one day and she chooses violence !!😂😂😂😂
"When Yoongi said ""my mom said she adopted me from under the bridge"" i felt that and can relate. Is it just as asian thing for parents, especially moms to say that to you when you are being naughty? Lol."
I'm sorry suga But I COULDN'T BREATH AT YOUR MOM'S COMMENT! I WAS LAUGHING SO HARD.
V wants a girl like his mother who cares him anytime 😭😭😭😭😭❤
"There's no part that Suga mom told him ""why Taehyung english better than him"".  😂😂😂 It's funny when i hear it again. I don't which ARMYs made that video."
Suga : My mom told me she adopted me from under a bridge .  Me : My mom always tells me that 👁💧👄💧👁   Edit : Thx for the likes 👍😊  And if your parents don't want you? I'll happily adopt you all as my Army children 💜💕
"3:52 Jungkook calling Bang Shihyuk a pig LMAO WHY WOULD HE ROAST HIM LIKE THAT, HE REALLY DID HIM DIRTY 😂😭😂😭😂😭"

4:19 Jimin says “it’s illegal hyung “ so innocently lol I’m laughing so hard I keep watching it
Now I know from where suga got is savageness
1:05 now we know from where yoongi got his savage side.....
We should be like Jungkook’s mom so that we end up with our crush. I wish I had her confidence. 😩
"5:09  Yoongi: *""My mom saw me on TV and told me I looked like a boiled dumpling.""*  LMAOOOO NOW I KNOW WHERE YOONGI GETS HIS SAVAGE SIDE FROM AHAHAHA"
"An Old Saying, A Family That Plays Together, Stays Together!  BTS Is Definitely A Family!  💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
Yoongi finding out his dad was Santa and Jin dad being practical about there not being a Santa will forever be the highlight
Okay so seeing SUGA'S comment who all have heard from their elder siblings that they were adopted?
Suga:- my mom saw me on tv and told me I looked like a boiled dumpling Army:- now we knew from where Suga got his savage side😎😎😂😂 Lol!!
Yoongi : my mom told me that  she adopted me  from under of bridge    So .... Am going to my birth place 😂😂😂 the whole family is savage 😂😂😂
"I always wonder about Taehyung's family tbh. I know, he always talks so lovely about his family and I'm not familiar with how people grow up in Korean but i can't help but wonder why he was raised by his grandmother. He said his father only came to see him at the weekends, not mentioning his mother, which kinda means she came to see him even less. Maybe it's normal in korea to sometimes not live with your parents but I'm just curious. He always says he lived with his grandparents, never mentioning that his siblings did as well but it wouldn't make much sense, why he should be the only one to not live with them. I imagined it to be kinda sad to be apart from the people who were supposed to be there for you everyday. Im just sharing my thoughts and my opinion, so please do not be offended in any way. I was just writing down my thoughts."
My absolute favourite one is Jin: Doesnt't everyone talk his or her mom at least an hour a day? I hope him mother is still this important for him.
When jungkook was talking about how his parents met that's exactly how my parents met💜💜💜
So cute Kim Taehyung.He is very good son.He is so nice one dear 💜💜💜
3:43 this was hilarious!🤣🤣
10:11 and that's when jk decided to embark on his journey to become The Muscle Bunny
I lost it when suga’s mom said he looked like a dumpling 😂😂
"V: ""Jimin is innocent and kind hearted"" Me: ""That's why I like him"""
His mom said he looked like a boiled dumpling. I've heard from mine that I looked like the back end of a bus in a particular dress....   Moms😑🤣
"Hope they can all attend on Dawon’s wedding. That would be cute, all of her dongsaeng being there."
"No wonder Jin is such a good cook, he got scolded every time he cooked something wrong"
*J-hope's sister is J-hope just with long hair*                             -Min yoongi   I AgReE....👁👄👁
1:09 Suga reminding his mom's words and then there's jk tryna look like a bad boy ...and failing cuz he just looks a cute bunny boy

I burst into laughter when I see jungkook Talking about their parents love story😂😂 my stomach hurts

Imagine THE Kim Taehyung asking for your autograph -  Yoongi cleary got his savageness from his mum.
I just realized that taehyung has a little sister and he chose him to introduce to his younger sister. Wow vmin their relationship.. Their bond.
I think yoongi's mom is the reason why he is so savage😂
1:48 Jungkook talking about his grandmother is so cute and funny😆😂💜
Je suis morte 😂😂 personne à voter pour Yoongi pour qu’on lui présente leur soeur 😭😭
i can now see that suga got his savageness from his mom
1:07 suga's whole family is savage    Peroidt
Hobi wants her sister introduce to jungkook and Jimin said it's illegal🤣🤣🤣
"7:13 Come to me taetae ,I'll look after you lovingly"
Yoongi is still lucky. My mom told me she picked me from a cemetery.
Now we know from whom suga got the savage attitude..
2:43 RM is not reading he's rapping 😐😂
Yoongi= ....and my mum told me that I was like a boilde dumbling
"Jin and his family is just amazing 😂 ""Practical Dad""👌😂"

Yoongi said his mother told him he was adopted form under a bridge  My mom also says the same thing
""" I like mom so i hope my girlfriend can be like a mom and take care of me ""  ~V"
"Kookie first time on tv Kookie-- mom! Mom! I am on tv now  Now-- he will say that mom! Mom! I am one of the member of bts and i m present in grammys,mma,gda etc can u see mee🤣🤣   Proud mom😍😍"

"""This is very vulnerable work"" was a line well said. What really makes suga one of my favourite rappers in the group is because in every song I immediately just relate to his lyrics, his flow, the way he changes up and experiment with the type of sounds he makes and his cool yet passionate voice. It's just something so unique to him and he has such awareness how to really connect people to his thoughts.  I'm not even a big fan of rap, but Suga changed that for me. It made me see a different color of rap than what I was used to hearing."
the guy who explained how the map of the soul was is SO smart
"The guy who is talking on the last part, he is the only person that I've saw who said that ""now I know why BTS is big"" and he's talking about the lyrics/concept or theme of the song and not because it's a BOP thing. I mean there's nothing wrong about the bop thing but you know what I mean. No offense"
i really liked that guy with the blue sweater explaining everything towards the end. i could listen to him for hours. he definitely made me see the meaning of this song differently
"Their whole Map of the Soul Album is referencing Karl Jung's theory of the Map of the Soul. Through their songs, BTS also wants to tell us that If we donot understand and accept the darker aspects of ourselves, then the self we love is not our true self, but rather an idealised version."
"They perfectly comprehend what Suga was trying to say.  I must say Jason analyse was so on point, i think he absolutly need to react to some of Suga's older work like the song The Last on his mixtape Agust D, he may appreciate ""the monster hungry for fame"" that Suga is talking about in that song . I also appreciate the fact that he says that now he know why BTS are famous !!! Yes that's it their lyrics and poeticism !"
ITS BEEN A WHOLEASS YEAR SINCE THE RELEASE AND IM STILL HERE FOR IT YESSSS I’ll gladly always wait 😂
"shadow is a musically rich song,, gonna enjoy this!!!!"
"Jason at the end explaining the map of the soul and what the meaning really is behind shadow was MINDBLOWING OH MY GOD I want him to react to all the intros: persona, shadow and ego back to back, I wanna hear what he has to say about all of them and the connection between them"
The guy is like a detective army he figured it out right away the image of Jung's theory is so right we first noticed that right away when the song comes out
"This is not music related but the editing never fails to make me smile, its so magnifique😂"
"I have friends that are psychology majors, the only songs in BTS that they listened to are the Persona, Shadow and Ego. And they would always message me that they did such a good job turning into music Carl Jung's work."
Perfect but that last comment kinda of made me want to see the guy reacting to The Last especially when he talked about how the ending sounds almost like a monster hungry for fame cause that's exactly what Yoongi says in The Last
"I think the beginning where he saying I want this and I want that somewhat sounds like a child saying ""I want this and I want that"" so I think he purposely made it sound childish to represent his younger self being passionate and wanting to dream and bigger dream."
"Adding on to what Ju Young said, she mentioned that in BTS' old songs they had the verse ""I want big cars, big house, big rings."" And in the full version of the song, the one on Spotify and Apple Music, etc, Suga actually references that line!"
"Fun fact: in this song, Suga reversed a sample from their 2013 song Intro: ORUl82 from their first mini album. It goes with the other 2 rapline songs in this album where RM sampled Intro Skool Luv Affair from their second mini album for his MOTS song Intro Persona, Jhope sampled Intro: 2 Cool 4 Skool from their debut album in his MOTS sing Outro Ego. They did this because mots7, in addition to exploring Carl jung's work, BTS also wanted this album to be a reflection on their past 7 years as a group"
"""I'm afraid, flying high is terrifying No one told me How lonely it is up here""  I can't imagine what they've gone through. Jin once said that he lose some of his friends and performing was the only thing keeps him going and after the concert, they're alone in their hotel rooms feeling empty."
Praise to the guy explaining MOTS. Yes that’s exactly why I fell in love with BTS. The creative geniuses they are when it comes to delivering a concept/messages always never fail to amaze me
"They got it!  They all connected personally with some facet of the song, and I think that was the point.  We all (in different ways) connect with Suga and with the shadow aspect in ourselves, and can understand Suga's POV."
*The best part of this reaction videos is that EVERYONE HERE IS FUCKING GENIUS and they always get the meaning or give a point of view super cool. THIS CHANNEL IS JUST CHEF KISS*
"Thanks a lot for this reaction !  Now, I'm a bit sad when people take the lyrics of No More Dream literally. Just read the next lyrics :  ""I want a big house, big cars and big rings,  But actually, I don't have any big dreams"".  In my opinion, the song is about how young people don't have actual dreams, they just want the things everyone want and tell them to want. I think Bangtan were mocking this materialism and conformism from the beggining.  (just in case it isn't clear, I'm not angry and am not hating anyone, just hoping to share knowledge/opinion)"
And ladies and gentlemen that is why BTS hits differently for me and many others🙏
This is in reference to Suga: Suga didn't have enough finances to pursue his passion of music..I wanna be rich Suga was scared of the stage in the early days...I wanna be a rockstar Suga and BTS had so many haters and impediments...I wanna win Simple words with deep meanings In the end Suga is still Min Yoongi..if you know what I mean...
The guy at the end explaining Jungian theory yes my guy.. you deserve an award.. the only one who got it on the first shot.. BTS's music has layers upon layers you just need the right mind and sight to unpack everything..
"geez, last guy understood this better than armys, in his first watch wtf"
holy shit that visual effect with the whole map of the soul thing is so cool i never caught that. its super smart how they represented that with yoongi on stage and offstage. once again thanks umu for these reactions and the reacters for giving us knowledge and insight on these things.
Oh my god just how good Suga is!!
who's the king? who's the boss?   MIN SUGA 👑
Came straight from watching Biden sworn in and now this. Great start to my day here in New Zealand. :)
"IDK why but I didn't expect ""he's got range"" to be a comment coming from this but I don't protest it a bit. This reaction surprised me in a lot of ways! Thanks everyone! 👍"
SUGA personally learn psychology and often being caught read psychology books also want to get license. That's why his rap is always poetically beautiful and often referencing psychological things
I would like for some of these people to react to Persona and Ego together with Shadow. Really good commentary on all aspects of this video.
I know for a fact that girl’s gonna have an existential crisis when she hears Felix’s voice for the first time if Suga took her aback so much xD
"i really loved how all of them delved deeper into the meaning of the song, not only sonically, but also lyrically and visually. that was a great breakdown by Jason on the references to Jungian psychology. absolutely loved the reaction!"
i’ve always interpreted the beginning of shadow (“i wanna be a rap star” etc) as this simplistic but deep ambition almost child like and stubborn. and the fact that he uses english to say all these simple sentences also emphasizes this kinda mantra about ambition. sometimes yoongi’s use of english is deliberate and so smart in the way he places it on the song. can only thinking about how he uses english in ‘people’ and ‘blueberry eyes’ as an example of this
Suga is truly genius producer and songwriter
The way Jason explained everything.... He should definitely react to The Last by Suga....PLEASEEE
"""i don't believe his voice is that low"" we've all been there i think 😭"
Jason's analysis of the Shadow concept was just so amazing to see
He once said that he wanted to do music but somehow he doesn't want to be famous and now he's really really famous...😶
"I think the ""I wanna be ... "" is meant to sound childish so they could represent their younger and past selves"
"When you actually get all things you wanted, what else is left to want? And then, who are you really once you've accomplished it all?   That's what I get from this song....."
"One of the best reactions! Kevin and Jason really nailed it with their comments and observations. It's great that they brought their knowledge of music, film and psychology to the table. This is kind of why I started watching ReacttotheK's videos back when it was first established and also why I'm staying til this day. I always learn so much from the casts' reactions in every video.  Thank you, Umu and friends for the opportunity to learn more! Keep on keeping on! And stay safe and healthy <3"
"The opening words ""I wanna be a rockstar,"" etc. is from their first song No More Dreams. These words deeply reference their growth and experience as artists and from puberty to young men, from worldly illusion to reaity."
The guy who explained extensively about Jung psychology also needs to drop his skincare routine
"Yes finallyyyyy, i love how everyone expresses their thoughts on the music and the video itself thank you guys"
We don't talk about this masterpiece enough One of his best tracks
"Honestly, this and Black Swan embodied the concept of MOTS. The other songs in the album (although still really, really good like my personal fave, Louder than Bombs and Ugh) did have some throw away lines but didn't really fully reach the full potential of the concept. And there were songs that also didn't fit the concept at all.  Also: I miss Kendrick Lamar."
"The pride i felt when he said ""now i know why btz is big"" yes"
"I would love for Jason and Raffi to analyze Suga's mixtape D2. They are very very smart and sensitive . The way Suga shows his vulnerability is to highlight.""lyrics and poeticism"" That is why Suga is my fav rapper. 🖤🖤"
I WAS NOT READY for First Love to start playing out of nowhere 😭
I love that Shadow is getting treated like the art that it is.
"I'd just like to say that the part where he says ""I wanna be a rockstar, I wanna be the top..."" is a reference to their first song in which his verse began with ""I want a big house, big cars and big rings"" It's supposed to represent who he was in 2013 debuting with BTS a group from a small company and the rest of the song shows who he is as a person today, a member of BTS, one of the biggest groups in the world."
YESSSSS so happy to see this!! Love that this channel gets into the music process aND more.  Love you guys💕🥺
"Oop, do they know that Yoongi and Max don't just vibe with each other? They're really good friends."
Well this was a surprise
I'm so grateful for Kevin and Owen's presence cause the references they make and their points are AMAZING
Dont forget that Yoongi had social phobia. So it is a really deep song
"Because Jason was already fully aware of Jung and his work, I find that he was prepared for what Shadow was expressing while he listened and watched. He was completely tapped in and his breakdown of the song and video was a masterclass. I’m curious as to how Jason is so familiar with Jung.  It was nice to see so many of the reactors speak about how the song relates to them being musicians as well. Not just a breakdown of the music but the lyrics as well."
"Please react to ""Daechwita"" next by Agust d aka suga"
Wow I love the in depth look into the music and music video! Great video!
HOW can someone just analyze everything from one watch I literally have to repeat the song for a couple of times until I notice half the things that they noticed lmaoo
"''...this is vulnerable work"" -, a Yoongi stan is crying"
"Hi guys! BOBBY from iKON will release his second album on Jan 25th, and the title track is named ""야 우냐 (U MAD)"", I think you should take a look at it once it comes out!! He is known in the k-hiphop scene and it's his first comeback as a soloist in 3 years. Hope you check him out <3 Stay safe!"
As a psych major I really love the ending and how deep Jason gets into talking about Jung and his theory.
Wow I didn’t know there was a Swedish film titled Persona that Yoongi referenced here. That was a great catch! I feel like I need to become more cultured in areas like art and film. Expand my horizons. :’)
"Hiiii, BOBBY from iKON will release his second album on Jan 25th, and the title track is named ""야 우냐 (U MAD)"", I think you should take a look at it once it comes out!! He is known in the k-hiphop scene and it's his first comeback as a soloist in 3 years. Hope you check him out <3 Stay safe guys!"
"omfg the way the last guy spoke about MOTS & explained everything... so smart! also love how he understood why BTS is so big, it's so much more than just great music ♥"
This is why Suga is my ultimate bias. He explores a part of himself and fame that I seldom see in Kpop. It is so deep and vulnerable that literally all of it makes me so emotional.
kevin's analysis never dissapoint! thoroughly enjoyed this one.
"*I love how they got the message well. This song really is robbed, SUGA really writes one of the deepest song. Thank you!*"
"Raw, piercing lyrics with fancy and superior beats = Suga's"
"About the deepness, suga talks like this"
Oh my god yasssss!!!! WHAT A KING
"Hi guys! BOBBY from iKON will release his second album on Jan 25th, and the title track is named ""야 우냐 (U MAD)"", I think you should take a look at it once it comes out!! He is known in the k-hiphop scene and it's his first comeback as a soloist in 3 years. Hope you check him out <3 Stay safe!"
I love seeing smart people who gets what BTS wants to convey in their songs and MVs. An instant A for this IQ test!
They guy who talked last was very impressive and I noted he is the one well understood this song.
"The ""I wanna be a rockstar.."" part is amazing cause the basic wording makes it sound like a mantra he said to himself when he wanted to achieve something, but now that he has it and still craves for the same, the mantra has transformed into an inner voice that haunts him."
estou a chorar! Yoongi é um génio. obrigada
The guy in red really missed the point of the song.  The “I wanna be a rockstar” is not bragging or a flex..totally missed the point. The guy in blue at the end understood the song perfectly.
"This was so awesome, Thank You all so much. I loved hearing your thoughts on it and sharing the love for this song and their album. Love love love love!"
Yoongi is king
I'm so stressed from how good all of this is. the song the rapper the MV the concept the reactions and the reactors and the discussion. ugh brilliant. shit
"That’s the thing I love so much about this channel.  It takes the songs I know and love and allows me to not only revisit the depth behind them but to also be introduced to new ones through the reactor’s musical analysis, critiques, and thoughts. Umu if you see this, just wanna say thank you for creating a platform that allows for thought provoking appreciation for this culture of music."
"Kevin completely understood what Yoongi was trying to convey in his song especially when he said how in the 1st part it sounded intentionally egotistical. It was interesting listening to the guys' take on the mv, there's sm going on and they all added their own theories to it. Overall I enjoyed it ^^ it would be interesting if you could make them listen to their mixtapes as well"
"honestly many people don't realize how deep his voice actually is and like to forget it. Yoongi has a really deep voice while talking and rapping, even when he jokes to sing opera. (he is a baritone if I am not mistaken now) It is just that he talks so calm, quite almost bored and not that often that you don't really realize it. His deep voice should get more appreciated."
You should absolutely react to Daechitwa next!  Them analyzing what happens next to Suga's two personas in the music video would be exciting to watch
"I'd really like to know if I'm the only person in the world who thinks this and Interstellar's main theme are so similar? Interstellar is one of my all time favorite movie sound tracks (I mean, not just favorite I'm actually obsessed with it lmao) and my mind went there the very exact moment i clicked on play button when Shadow dropped and I was SOOOO excited and happy waiting for people to mention it but I've never seen anyone mention it and it makes me feel lonely lol"
"The help the people understand in the video that the lyrics “I wanna be a roaster, I wanna be the top...” are talking about younger Min Yoongi: in the beginning, the glass is being rebuilt as a mirror with him standing behind it, the glass doesn’t break until he runs toward it and ends up on stage. The microphone is the object that ends up breaking the glass."
I love how they thought yoongi has a higher voice and gets surprised when hearing him xDDD
"Uh so this is not hate,I'm just trying to understand. Individual reactions(like comeback singles, album first listens and reviews) are paused right? So for example, an album listen of BE from BTS won't happen very soon right? Is there a video explaining this? I'm just not updated lol 😶"
"Love the reaction, thank you all so much for this!!"
"The don't let me shine, don't let me fly gets me every time."
He is accepting his shadow inner self as well as the famous self and is at peace with himself in the last scene when he is among the crowd as opposed to earlier. You see the black clothed Suga (shadow) in the crowd looking up at the white clothed famous suga on top just before the last acceptance scenes.
ok now I wanna marry yoongi AND jason
"I love everyone's reaction. I also love how in depth and aware they are with the overall concept of this song! ""Interlude: Shadow"" is one of my favorite BTS songs because of how lyrically deep it is. You can really feel the emotion and pain in Yoongi's voice. The lyrics, MV, their reactions, and everything else come together so well. Everyone reacting is so insightful."
"This video was incredible, seeing the reactors dig in to the genius that is Yoongi and this song was just so emotional and amazing. This song was incredibly vulnerable for Yoongi indeed, especially considering it was released at such a height of BTS' fame. Thank you so much for reacting to Shadow, and thanks to all the in depth observations from the reactors."
"17:00 I love him for understanding all the deepness and background of the song and what it was actually making reference to, in this case the theory of Jung. Gosh I wanna kiss his forehead and say thank you.🤣🙏🏽"
"Deep? Vulnerable, you say? Please check out ""The Last"" in the August D album. That shit hurts 😭  Anyways Ju Young, giiiiirl, you rock! I purple youuu😭💜"
"We are so thankful that we live in South Australia where the cases of COVID-19 are significantly low and our restrictions have begun to ease. As an extra preventative measure all members in K-UA,  are still practicing proper sanitary hygiene precautions when together practicing and filming. We encourage all our subscribers to please continue to do the same and stay safe, especially in areas still highly infected with the virus. This is a rough time for everyone all around the world, so we all need to work together and stay strong in order to fight back against this pandemic!   Stay safe and stay healthy everyone 🥰"

That cat look like its trying to solve a math problem😂
Moral of the story: DON'T TRUST THE DAMN INTERNET
"""His strange addiction to black color was clearly showing."" Me having my cereals in black bowl with black spoon. Also wearing black leggings with oversized black shirt."
The fact that im watching this on my red days with my cat who looks like Yn's cat😁😁 the coincidence
The fact that I’m single and watching this made   me more single 😭
"There's an Indian advertisement of washing powder and it has a famous dialog ..."" Daag acche hai ""  Now I get to know why !!! 😂😂😂. The one who is an indian army will definitely understand this ....stains are always good 😝😉😉"
"2:29 ""His strange addiction to black color was clearly showing"" you didn't have to come at me like that."
'Then i found out that my pyjamas along with my hoodie were stained in blood' See!!? This is why i fricking hate tampons Pads always wins!!
I decided to read comment and saw everyone here is hating tampons and loving pads 😂😂😂 Ps:I hate them too 😂😂
I'm watching this while I'm on my period

"I clicked this by mistake and this is my favourite mistake, 😭"
"Y/n crying for three hours because she is scared of Jungkook meanwhile me who cried for about 4-5 hours straight because I was getting separated from my sisters who were going back home meanwhile I had to stay with my other half family to help them out with my pregnant aunt. The reason why I cried is because it was my first time ever getting separated from my sisters, especially when it's really far away from home. I was in a different state. It felt like hell just watching them heading to the airport, I was their protector from anything in this world. I'll do anything for them, I always will have them infront of me and myself behind them watching them, making sure they are safe. I realized I wasn't ready to let go of my sisters, wasn't ready to move on onto my future plans without them."
Why did I cry when Lovely started playing?! This is amazing 🥺💜💜💜
Part 2 y/n and Jk's REVENGE to y/n's adoptive parents pls 🙏 also if you can't or you don't want to make it its ok.Then I just ask for shoutout Borahae

"pls sis i thought i was dying when my period first started. I screamed the hell outta my voice and made everyone in the house so scared then my dramatic ass ran out the toilet screaming ""IM DYING MUM WHAT DO I DO"" 💀"

Okay now this is actually the BEST ff I’ve ever read from every ff I’ve read
"I dunno why but when I saw Y/n cat, my head tilted the same way where the cat's head was tilted. Then I showed it to my sister and noticed that she tilted her head a bit too. Well that's.... weird."

The violin 🎻 literally sings by itself
"Life goes on en violin y piano, yo- 🥺💜 Suena hermoso"
"Imagine having a boyfriend that can play piano and violin. He played it for you everytime you feel down and cuddle with you just to comfort you.  Hol up, this is just an imagination."
"No se ni que decir, es indescriptible el sentimiento de escucharle, simplemente inefable."
BTS ❤ Life goes on ❤ Y luego Daniel tocandola AMOOOOOO 💞

O mais lindo é perceber que o músico está feliz e se divertindo quando está tocando.👏👏
"I just love each of their covers, each one has a unique energy, I like it a lot ... it inspires me a lot to hear them"
"Me encantan tu videos, eres el mejor espero llegar a tocar como tu😀😀😀😀😍😍😍😍😍😍"

I am going to recommend this violin cover of BTS's Life Goes On to my friends. Specially those who are now stressed about their acads. This cover is amazing. I love all of your violin covers.

You really said let’s post this right when Im having a anxiety attack after my mom just screamed at my dad...  Thank you very much
I forget studing and beginning to sing with music  😂😂😂💔This is the army's biggest problem 🌚💔
"it breaks my heart to know that there is too many young people are in pain, including me. the world is a bad and dark place and the situations we are in right now are not our fault. we did not deserve to live this. but I am proud of you that you put up with all this every day and still haven't lost your hope. this is a safe place. let's put everything aside and take a deep breath. smyang thanks for this place. and girls and boys remember this lyrics “Hoping that tomorrow I'll laugh more, for me” good bye 💜"
"I've been having a hard time recently coping with trauma so this came at the right time, thank you 💜 I love your music 🥺💜"
"Thank you so much, I really need this.🥺 Only BTS can comfort me...💜"

"my favorite channel for accompany me while studying, relaxing, or sleeping ..."
love how V's demo of spring day is incorporated into the piano version of spring day <3
"OMG yes!🥰 Now I can study longer!! This is the longest one I've passed by, thanks!!💜💜"
"Begin sounds absolutely heartbreaking. Funny how it's even sadder than the actual sad songs done by the other members on WINGS. I've recognized all of the songs from WINGS except MAMA. I've listened to this quite a bit but still can't recognize that song when it's played.  Anyways, Begin sounds terribly tragic on piano. It sounds like a song about losing your family, not finding them. Everytime I hear it I get emotional. >.<"
"Hi Smyang!🙋😀😎. I hope u & family r doing well. Just got home, to fond out u just put this collection out, lol. Thank u. Now I can have a glass of wine, unwind, & relax. Need to finish writing. Ur piano collection is going to be my force drive.. Merci mon amie."
"THANK YOU SO MUCH for this playlist! 💜 As a new army, I am very grateful to BTS for their healing music and your piano covers simply put us in happy tears... thank you once again!💜🤗🙏"

"""Can you speak more slush (slowly)""       🤣"
"He's so cute, funny, kind hearted, sweet, talented and unique and his voice is my favorite, plus he has charisma like no other and his stage presence is amazing, and he's great at using facial expressions. He was born to be on stage. The reason I'm ARMY now is because of him. He was the one who attracted me with his good looks but then when I watched more about him I learned not only him but all of BTS are more than just looks, I stayed because of their unbelievable talent and warm personalities. One second they're cute lil Winter Bears and the next they're just straight fire 🔥 It's hard to be either a soft stan or a hard stan so I'm both hehe In short...they are my everything 💜"
"Tae is silly, smart, thoughtful, creative, compassionate, funny, and so caring. He def wears his heart on his sleeve... shows such emotion... That is why I love him...💜💜💜☺️💜💜💜💜"

"Hi! Excuse me, you could make a video about Taehyung's  Special and Peculiar personality? 💕 It's just that V's personality has a lot to explore I'm surprised at the abrupt changes he has   he's very cute and adorable, he's like a baby, other times he's insanely funny (shows us his 4d personality)😂 other times he very sexy and charismatic, Especially on stage🔥 Looks like other person, is a big change 😱 , other times he shows us that he is serious and mature but He's still fun, making jokes with serious faces lol ❤️ other times he shows us how smart and cunning he is, even looking like a genius with the things he does as Nam and Yoongi said too, he has a unique perspective of seeing things and the life, It would be interesting to see how his personality changes or complement 💜 #taehyung #v #Taetae #btsv #kimtaehyung #bts #jungkook #jimin #jhope #hoseok #jin #namjoon #rm #seokjin #suga #yoongi #뷔 #김태형 #태국 #전정국 #뉴스 #뉴스킨 #티티 #티 #태태 #americannews #america #music #vlogs #tiktok"

"Jungkook’s tattoo sleeve visible during Run BTS cookery segment and the ARMY is not coping Showbiz news in January has been pretty weird, and we’re crossing another unexpected item off our 2021 bingo card – getting a close look at Jungkook’s tattoos during a ham-themed episode of Run BTS. The BTS ARMY is freaking out after being given one of their clearest peeks yet at Jungkook’s sleeve, which is usually covered up or censored in videos and performances. It all happened as Jungkook rolled up his sleeves for the latest episode of Run BTS on VLive, where the band – minus Suga, who is still recovering from shoulder surgery – attempted to make the best recipe possible from canned ham, to promote the Korean pork industry. With Korean celebrity chef Baek Jongwon judging, Jungkook, RM and J-Hope attempted to make a ham and potato stew, while Jimin, V and Jin whipped up ham, ramen and rice, in the hopes of winning special knives from Mr Baek.  https://shrinke.me/AIQj0XK"
Jungkook being himself.. Lets support him .
Jungkook is the cutest bunny in the world and he is naughty
why is he so cute huh pls tell me I think I'm gonna faint give. me. holy. water
"2:14 ""il fait chaud dans la salle"" french army lol"
JK 🐰💜
the cast is literally so beautiful bro
"hwang in yeop acting skills are amazing, just look at him please, he’s too shy compared to seojun, i can’t even believe they’re the same person"
He never properly look at her face while speaking or answering to her seems like someone is shy😉😂
"My obsession for In-Yeop is to the point where I can't find any other guy attractive. Send help, please."
I enjoyed this drama so much. It's not heavy drama. Everyone is so cool.
"Also, “Are you tired?”  “No.”   “Why are you breathing so fast.”   Lol. He did say he was nervous.     Thanks for the likes, everyone!!!!"
i will feel so empty after this drama ends :( like im just obsessed
1:17 that little smile. Why's he so cute🤭
3:01 he really thought eunwoo got hurt 🥺🥺🥺
Lmao. I like older guys as the fact that he’s 30 but looks 20 is like the best of both worlds.
"can't believe there are only two episodes left,so sad"
ga young is such a social butterfly. she’s looks friendly & cheerful to everyone.
"i keep repeating 1:02 the way inyeop answers her with ""no"" and that small conversation about tired and breathing hard, it doesn't look like two actor and actress anymore, it looks kinda personal if yk what i mean 👁😂"
0:47 the fact that he put a towel to cover her legs
Lol I'll always remember this scene(4:01) every time I see a leopard print 😂
Can anyone talk about how cute in yeop🥺
In the first episodes I was really addicted with Eunwoo but as I watch different BTS vids each day i'm getting more obsessed with Inyeop HAHAHA I've never been addicted to Kdramas not until I watched True Beauty.
MKY: are u tired? HIY: no MKY: then why are u breathing so fast?  how to calm down 👁️👄👁️💧
"In yeop be like : i'm super nervous // others ""yes, you should be"""
"Since we've been looking for subs all the time, thanks for this! We camp out at tvn with korean auto-generated captions all the time lol"
"""Okie dokie yoo......."""
_Who else loves this show?!_   *I’m so sad it’s ending tho KSKDKDK* ✋🏻😭😭
"She is so obviously crushing on Inyeop, she constantly touches him, stares in his eyes. You see it in every interview. She acts very, very differently with Eunwoo. So cute!"
Gayoung looks so whipped for Inyeop
3:01 pls this part is so cute in yeop actually thought eunwoo got hurt :((
In Yeop’s robe dance is what I am here for 🥵
Moon ga young:Are u tired?😮 Inyeaop:No😅 Moon ga young:Then why r u breathing so fast😯  Lol just tell u have a crush on Moon ga young lol
HWANG INYEOP IS XTRA  CUTE WHEN HE'S SHY
*Now I'm falling for this drama.* *Please tell them that we like it very much.* *Borahae.* 💜
That scene of Hwang In Yeop is iconic😂
"In yeop is so cute, his smile aww"
Thanks VIU! I think i am already addicted to this drama specially to the cast! Hahaha 😍😍😘😘❤❤
I want to see them applying the acne scar makeup and pimples on Moon Ga Young. Maybe the super thick eyebrows too 🤣🤣🤣
"They should make seojun smile more in the drama , InYeop's smile is beautiful"
I really love Jugyeong's family! Her sister and her brother are just soo funny!!
"I'm so obessed with Moon gayoung and Cha eunwoo's real life chemistry 🥺🥺🥺 If you watch other episodes bts you'll know why ❤️ They're so cute, im dead"
This drama is one of the best....i love it #TRUEBEAUTY THE BEST!!!!!!
"post kdrama syndrome, looking back at these videos after the last episode :("
Inyeop is too cute and shy . His acting skill is beyond the world ❤️. Love him so much .
"its done, ITS FINISHED idk what to do, these bts scenes are my way of coping now🥲"
"FAV DRAMA,TRUE BEUTY ....W8ING FOR EP 13"
Awww gayoung and inyeop are both close in behind the scenes cuteee  Suhoo how handsome ugh my heart </3
There better be a season 2 I am crying this has been a rollercoaster ride and True beauty was my first ever drama I watched while it was coming out. These past 8 weeks have been stressful but I love this show with all my heart and I hope I get to see more shows like this.
"I can see that in yeop is really nervous when taping scenes with jugyeong😅 he is sweating, maybe because he feels awkward towards jugyeong.. But who wouldn't get sweat right? Lol maybe it's because its his first time to be one of the main characters on a drama.. So he's not that used to it, anyways.."
inyeop is such a cutie🥺💛
1:19 arggg the smile
"Hwang in yeop look so shy with moon ga young. He was like, try to avoid from looking at her eyes"
The funniest thing was Seo Jun coming out in his leopard underwear jamming to okey dokieo and then dropping water onto his hair to turn around and see Ju kyung and his sister just staring at him 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I laughed so hard istg
"Why do I sometimes forget that BTS also means behind the scenes? I read somewhere, BTS Jin is going to make a special appearance in this drama, is it true?"
How is the whole cast so beautiful 🥺
i wish we saw Soojin too ♥ do you think they gonna put a happy ending for her ? and probably she gonna end with Seojun ? i will be happy if  they do ♥
Her smile is soo freakin cuteee  Especially at that bunny costume 😂😂
like goddd look how happy she is with seojun even in real life i love them toghether . I love their chemistry 🥺❤️😻
Seojun and Jukyung Can't be together but hwang in-yeop and moon ga-young can #HwangYoung❤️
me watching this while there are only two episodes left ㅠㅠ im gonna miss the cast.
"Hwang in yeop really like Moon Ga Young.. he avoid direct eyes contact when he close with her, and his heart beating like crazy.. Moon Ga Young ask why his breathing fast and ask him if he is tired.."
I love this drama so so much! The cast is beautiful and adorable 😭💜
They can literally give us behind the scene episodes of true beauty and I’ll watch all day
I haven’t even watched this kdrama BUT I KEPT REPEATING THIS SCENE & NOW HERE I AM WATCHING A BTS OF A KDRAMA I HAVENT EVEN WATCHED 😂😭

I love how they blurred out the tvn logo and just put true beauty on it loll
Suho 💜
SECOND LEAD SYNDROME 100%💜😍

3:01 Seo Jun really cares🤍

She's comfortable with both but more with In Yeop ❤️

"New episode out now!! Post Malone & Tyler, the Creator Trivia 🎶Stan vs. Stan https://youtu.be/FMx4BVkCCnI"
"AMI! BLINK! ARMLINK WYA?! Who said k-pop fans were only teenage girls??? Don’t fan war, FAN MORE!!! Thank you MTV! 💜🖤💖"
"BTS ones were so easy wth, I would have definitely win 🤸🏻‍♀️"
Says idol. Shows mots: persona. That album does'nt even have that song on it.
ArmyLinks watching this: *We are superior*
im concerned on why he showed a persona album when idol played...instead of love yourself 😐
When the Blink knew all the BTS answers too.
MTV you should've invited Cameron Philip K....he is a true hardcore BTS armyy...he has a yt channel and insta acc💜✨
😂she had a jungkook poster and bts posters she is a armyblink for sure
Me knowing all the answers: 👁️👄👁️👍🏻
9:45 Q: In which country Bts didn't performed ?  Ans: India 😭🇮🇳
How did the world did my dude forgot the ICONIC Tae White and Bangtan Dwarfs!?😭
*Answers IDOL while holding a Persona album*
"If  U r an army , u will get real anxiety when he said v is a virgo and when he said idol but points at the mosp album."
How couldn't he know Yoongi's dogs name like every army knows it
Definitely no hate buh they should’ve put an only BTS stan or basically somone who knew them more cause he seemed to be more of a blink🙃
now ya’ll really should’ve invited me
I was screaming at my screen. I got all of them right. I wish we have a better representation of ARMY.
Im a kid and I knew all of the answers of BTS 🙂 it pissed me off when the guy couldn't answer the easiest questions bruh
Is it just me whos triggered a lot when the boy got wrong bcuz hes been an ARMY longer than me? Lol its quiet sad
"""which member has no piercings?"" Me: Jhope Him: Jin  aight I'm out"
When you’re an armyblink.. and answer every single question right.
WHEN YOU ARE BOTH ARMY AND BLINK😁💜✨✌️
I am kinda disappointed in the guy    LIKE HOW COULD U DO US LIKE THIS
I’m like 6 months into the fandom and I could get all answers right lmao 😂💜
me: an armyblink me again: guessing bts's and blackpink's question every round also me: so...who should i cheer on 👁👄👁
"Dizzy is a fairly new fan everyone, cut him some slack. lol."
Jhope doesn’t have piercings before but he does now
this was soo easy peasy the army boy could have won
"I love dezzy, he's cool but how does mtv cast fans lol.??  He's still a fairly new army but honestly he did pretty good!  We could've moved on, its ok I guess. Congrats to the girl"
yoongward! lmfao man i'm surprised dezzy wasn't for blackpink !! king blink!
I knew the answer to who are the Virgos because RM once said he was a Virgin 😂
"Me: being a Year old ARMY, shouting all the right answers at the screen out of frustration. my Mom: ""she has gone MAD""  🤭💜 Thanks for making it a highlighted comment. 🤭🤭🤭🤭"
i dont like the use of the word stan. ARMYs and BLINKs or fans are perfectly fine. its not a freaking cult
I'm just here to say to some peoples something...We should maintain respect towards every Artists I'm just BTSARMY but I respect every  artists even I'm not Supportive to them. We should focus on our IDOLS and respect them cause they're humans before IDOLs...
Biggest Boyband in the world- BTS Biggest girlband in the world-Blackpink  Armyblinks rise and shine 💜
being a hardcore armyy i think that its good tjat blinks won this fanwar cause their fandom gets a lot of hate
"""She's getting a tattoo saying 8 8 16, the date she first fell for blackpink""  So um since debut?"
I could have performed better than that army guy😂
"That boy doesn't know that BTS doesn't come to Mexico or Latin America, it may be a ""world"" tour but we are never on it."
“Idol”  *shows map of the soul persona*
Not remembering the famous live in SaudiArabia is almost as big mistake as not knowing Holly's name. I mean... How can he even be an ARMY while not knowing Holly's name???
when the bts stan said “easy it’s idol!” and shows a persona album ??? 😭
*When you know mostly all the answers but cannot compete.....* 😭😭😭💜💜💜💜💜 *HI ARMY!!!*
I question myself in the first round is he even an army dude the questions are so damn easy
When even an army knew all the answers to the blackpink ones-
The guy: idol Also the guy: **shows the persona album**
Am I the only one who's just freaking frustrated and kinda crying cause I knew literally all the answers to the BTS questions even after being a 2020 ARMY when this 2000days ARMY did'nt get quite some of the questions? :)
"I love how i automatically knew what my fave Lisa's lips looked like right away lol.  Also, I had 15 points and went all in, so i have 30. Let me get in the hotseat. Let's go #blinks!!! Win it all!!"
Honestly they should have put another person for the bts stan position . . . He was more of a blink for how it looks like . . . Though i love how there is no hate between them  Omfg 1.1k y'all are insanee tysm 😆💜
"MTV done did ARMY bad. Y'all could've had Cameron Phillips here. Also wondering how he got those questions wrong 😬😬  I literally would've won had I been on this 👩🏾‍🦯  That being said, congrats Lily"
"""We don't talk anymore?"" ""Correct! Just like me and my dad!""   💀"
"Dezzy knew more about the songs than the boys themselves. It was painful to watch  because I couldn't tell him the answers but, he tried his best."
"""is it we don't talk anymore?"" ""Correct, Just like me and my dad"""
Dezzy wants to answer for Blackpink so badly😂
Me answering the earring question: “wait a damn sec- Hobi doesn’t have earrings doesn’t he?! naw that’s wrong but wai- *realizes I’ve never seen him wearing earrings**” MTV: “j-hope has no earrings!” Me: “😳🤭Bruh how the fuc- I’m so jungshook rn how have I just realized this”
When I have been a fan of BTS for only 3 months but still knew more ans than that super fan😂
When the blink is also an exo-l im proud
Stanning KPOP GROUPS are FUN not until other fans sees it as a competion. STOP FANWARS SPREAD LOVE TO ALL THE GROUPS FAMOUS OR NOT! 💖
Feeling so happy to see no HATE AND FANWARS in the comment section
me literally answering here in my room and my sister be like  'Whom are u talking to?'😂😅
"Me, an ARMYBLINK, getting every question right on both sides-"
"When they said who is the youngest member of bts and he answered ""kookie"" KING!!"
there should be NO fanwars. This video was just made to see who knows their group more. Its nothing to do with which group or fandom is better.
"BTS's questions were very easy, but the man tried hard even though he needs to know more"
Not at me swearing everytime he got the answers wrong 😭😭
Guys we need to be supportive with other armys too. I'm grateful for him being an army and i hope he keep doing it to eventually know all those things 💜 remember: the most important is supporting the boys 💜
"When the ""stan"" has been in the army for twice as long as you, but you get all the questions right! How could you not know holly , where the concerts were or the V and the dwarfs outfits  (they are on a ton of bts videos and memes my guy!) And the birthdays too 💔 Also why was I shouting at the screen 😂"
This is funny cus Dezzy is actually a bigger fan of BLACKPINK lol
Mexican Armys in the last question: 👁💧👄💧👁 **cries in tercermundista**🇲🇽
Remember things about BP is quite easy because they are quite similar to our tastes and its easy to remember ( and the fact that it's a lil short than king bangtan) Good job to both groups and fans
"I am an army I know most of the blink questions. I also gussed lisa's lips right, it was shocking for me."
All Blinks are proud of you Lili ❤️👏
Me: Who answered all the questions and hoping I am there.
you not only made blackpink proud but you made us blinks proud too Keep it up we blinks are with you!! (btw that boy had bp's lightstick too)
being armyblink in this video its not easy :((
ALL BLINKS SUPPORT IS IN YOU!!! FIGHTING!!🖤💗
"I’m routing for you Lily. Hope you keep the streak. Not only are you representing us blinks, but k-pop fans as a whole.  Good luck"
DONT START A FAN WAR PLEASE LOVE YOU MTV💜
I went like 'It's J-HOPE!You Idiot' ㅋㅋㅋㅋ I love Dez
I'm blink but know something about them because of Armies's comparison
I was screaming two.. twooo TWOOOO!!!!! Wtf! On Lisa's lips hahahaha
Let’s be honest that Army is us “lives in California but lives in Korean time 😂😂
Armyblink 💜💗
"I know the blackpink fan would win..she's literally obsessed with them, she's a real stan unlike the reactor."
Me as an Army knowing all the answers to the questions 🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️
"Army and blink forever , can't choose"
When you're a multi and you answered every BTS and BP question correctly-
proud of you Lily girl! Whohooah! Blackpink in your area. I love BTS too. I'm both an ARMY and BLINK. That was a tough game.
*✨BANGPINK* IS THE REVOLUTION ✨
BTS por el significado de sus canciones y su largo recorrido por la industria
We gotta show the power of kpop stans and let’s get 1st ❤️❤️
I can't choose loool!! Blackpink was my first stanning group! And i love bts. Guess its both! Armyblink for lifeeee Im more of a blink tho :( Still learning about bts! These are really helping me learn about bts
omg he turned out to be a blink too!
"No hate but the ""BTS stan""Sucks cause he don't even know the Tae snow white and the dwarfs Iconic choreo video like fr???"
I'm NOT bts VS black pink I'm BTS X BLACK PINK and ARMY X BLINK
"""We dont talk anymore"" ""just like me and my dad""😂😭 same tho"
"This is random but, in the corner where the scores were. They showed pictures of some of the members. They showed every member instead of Jisoo. Kinda disappointed Ngl... #JUSTICEforJISOO"
"""idol"" **shows Mots ; Persona**  are you sure this guy has been an army for over 2k days"
"Of course they would choose these two Kpop groups, Bts and Blackpink kings and queens of kpop. The nations groups"

"Ill admit, it has been a while since I made a full on BTS x Ariana mashup. The last time I did was with fake love and god is a woman (hello armynator audience 🤠) Anyways, hope you all enjoy!  DL: https://kjmixes.bandcamp.com/track/34-35-x-dynamite-mashup-ariana-grande-bts-doja-cat-megan-thee-stallion"
ariana: can you stay up all night?👀😏 bts: and can you light it up like dynamite?😃☺
when you are Army and Arianator at the same time and you don't know who was better 😔✌🏻
"I did not see this coming. But yes, ARITAN!!!"
Ohhh myy-  This is so smooth 🙌  The transition in Doja's part hit different thoo 😳😮
if this doesnt go viral ima be mad
Great song for those who are both ARMY and ARIANATORS.... like me💜💛❤
We need an Ariana and Bts Collaboration 2021 let’s hope 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜🔥🥰🥰🥰🥰🙌
I love it how the bts video is kinda innocent and the 34+35 is the opposite and how smooth these transitions and audio are
Hoping for BTS to collaborate with our  one and only ARI...
omfff bro this is so good
this is the kind of energy we need for 2021
this.is.a.masterpiece    try and tell me it’s not
i dont like k- pop but this is a bop. seriously everyone needs to see this

Ariana : singing   Jungkook : my banana milk 😋
This is the best thing I've heard all day🔥 It really made me smile😭😍😍
"Two completely different songs put together 34+35 - A Western song about adventures in the bedroom Dynamite - An Asian song of Seven South Korean lads who I don’t really know what they’re doing but whatever it is it’s adorable, do it again babies 🥰"
This means they all should collab
"YASSS!!! SOUNDS SIMILAR TO NICKNESS “F U, 2020” YEAR END MIX. ;)"
Armynator here😃🙋🏻‍♀️and this is bop⚡
It feels so fucking good ohmygosh what the fuck will happen to me when this collab will actually happen im not gonna be here i swear to god i'd be floating in air i swear 🤣 this is soooooooo AMAZING 😭❣️
It's the best mashup I've ever heard.....
DOJAS PART HOLY THIS IS INSANE

I know this mesh up is made cuz of Grammy's 😶😒 but still I love this😭❤❤❤

This video deserves millions of views❤️.
"I'm an arianator :) and this looks and sounds so amazing together!! I listened their dynamite alot after it's release but now I'm more addicted after this, that song is a bop"
MEG'S OART IM LITERALLY BUSSIN IT DOWN
Make it happen🤩👏🏾👏🏾
1:15 Yoongi came on the cat scene😂
Why is this so sick 😳 They should have a collab✋🏻
This is probably the best remix I’ve ever heard in Youtube!💕 Smoooooth❤️

damm how much i pray for them to collab
imagine this collab come true🤤
Omg Megan's part was the best!!
As a big fan of these amazing people....I love this mash up
Suddenly came to my mind that California Gurls by Katy Perry would be a perfect song for the mashup too.  On the other hand... THIS IS SO FUCKIN GLORIOUS.
"man, it's so underrated......This is soooooooooooooooooooooo goooood!!!"
This  is laced with crack I can't stop listening

1:49 i love this part so muchhhhhhhh
We just need a collab damnn
It sounds like a real song bruh I love it!!!
The reason I am still alive is BECAUSE of THIS . This channel keeps me going bruh-
1:16 S M O O T H
YES THIS WAS NEEDED
Best mashup i have ever heard in my life wow  i hope bts or ariana would see this vedio tho
*EARS BLESSED* 😍
"""I'm in the stars tonight"" gets another meaning here ;)"

MY TWO FAVOURITE SONGS THANK YOU SOOO MUCH I LOVE THISSSSS!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?💜💜💜💜💜
This is gonna be my favorite song ever!
...he was talking to the other members...
"He was never angry at the staff he was talking other members, and that was an accident"
Guys watch the full video he is talking to hoseok and that's why in end jin brings his ear closer to namjoon bcoz he wants to listen him properly... 🙂
He is a good leader
Namjoon doesn't begin anger to his staff he was talking with another member😹😹
As a group leader and best friend..✨😎🤘
Guys RM's a great leader.. he'll never misbehave with the staff.. He was talking to members.. that was an accident and also didn't hurt jin much.. but let me remind you if anyone will hurt any of the members our president won't keep quiet... And also BTS won't need to defend themselves.. they are the kings of the world right now... 💜💜💜💜
🐨Namjin🐹forever😘💜
Namjoom is not this kind of a person he was talking to someone else
Namjoon isn't agry at someone who is just doing their job. He doesn't even get angry at people who might deserve it like that. Jin knows it was an accident too. He was talking to a member to the side.
I know namjoon is talking to Hobi here...but i still wanna think he was angry on staff for accidentally hitting Jin...😁 #Namjin ✌🏻💜
Jin is like calm down baby i am okay
"Namjoon is the dad of bts if anybody hit the mom of bts ""jin"". The dad will be angry. And when anybody  shout the childrens he will kill him.😠😠😠"
He is never rude to anyone he was  just talking to  other member
Namjin real
Rm: khabr dar kisne bhi meri biwi ko hath lagya to. 😡😡😡
It seems like he was angry at staff ... But actually he was talking to other members🤗💜  He cant scold anyone !!__
Namjoon cuidando a su esposo o si
Jin so cute and rm i like jin
MEU MARIDO NAMJOON FICA BRAVO
Ocara nao pode bater assim no Jin tadinho🥺 quelindo nanjoon😍😍
He's a gentleman He was talking with other members 🙂
Dad is helping mom Namjin forever👨‍❤️‍👨👨‍❤️‍👨👨‍❤️‍👨💖💖💖
This isn't real actually staff by mistake hit jinie and joonie was just telling something to Hobi. Don't do this  because I don't know but some people might think joon is rude and bts never get angry on staff. Borahae💜💜💜
Namjin💜
To be honest... I am always with Namjin😚😚
LMAO he was talking to someone else that time not to staff😂
Namjin♡
HE WAS TALKING WITH ANOTHER MEMBER OF BTS IDK THR NAME BUT I'M SURE HE RESPECTS ALL STAFF MEMBERS....bcuz   HIS KIM NAMJOON!!!!
Namjin 💜💜
Perfect leader he deserves more love🐨🐨💜💜
"I know he was talking with hobi,but I don't want to understand, cause I like to see him careing of jinii💜💜💜💜💜💜💜😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍"

Namjin
Namjoon got mad when the mic hit jin .. namjin forever ❤️
Sharing is caring
"If i met Suga, jungkook, or any of the bts members. The first thing I'll do is be friends with them. Take them out.... If I was an adult and met them"
You are really a great leader🥰🙏💞💕💜💜💜👏👍
Bts dad: namjoon Bts mom: jin    Namjoon be like if you do it again😡😡    He is really protective towards his members  Love you bts and respect our leader or dad of bts: namjoon😌😌

So excited for you guys to hear/see this version. Thank you to lil mosey and Olivia for adding your artistry to SUGA and my song. Thank you to the fans for your love
Popular opinion: Everyone wants to see MAX and SUGA performing together.
"Lil Mosey did so fucking well, what an intro."
Lil mosey 2020: Blueberry faygo  Lil mosey 2021: Blueberry eyes
Do you realize that he is the only artist who has valued all the effort of yoongi? It is the only one who always gives credits we should always be grateful to him and remember you have to do more stream to bluberry eyes we agree that it is a tremendous beautiful song 💓 Thank you Max for your effort towards this song
"Fact: every comments wrote down here have ""Suga"" 😂"
MAX's producers: how many versions do you want of Blueberry Eyes? MAX: y e s  Edit: I- how in the world did this get so many likes- y'all are insane
"When yoongi said: ""suga"" GUYS I JUST HAVE A WORD....  G O O S E B U M P S"
I love how no matter how many versions he made he never cut Yoongi rap
"A diferencia de otros artistas que han colaborado con BTS o los miembros, Max se ha ganado el cariño de Army de una forma muy linda. Estoy contenta con esta colaboración.  STR3AM BLUEBERRY EYES!"
"Weno, crucen los dedos para que algún día, Yoongi aparezca en un MV de Blueberry Eyes u-u"
"Yoongi's ""SUGA"" whisper is finally added in this  version!!"
*Max+Suga+Lil Mosey+Olivia O'Brien=Art.*
Yoongi: **susurrando** SUGA Yo: ES MI VIDAAAAAAAAAA ES MI VIDAAAAAAAAAAA
"Ami, apoyemos el trabajo de Yoongi. Y también recuerden que tenemos metas que cumplir para su cumpleaños! u__u"
HE KEPT IN THE “Suga~” BEFORE YOONGI’S RAP VERSE-!!
Fact: everyone wants max and suga collab in one stage!!
No one: Literally no one:   Yoongi:suga
esta buena toda la canción no me canso de escuchar el rap de Suga
THE COLLAB COULD NOT GET ANY BETTER
"pensé que el gatito iba a salir, bueno no importa, lo importante es apoyar este remix que merece mas reconocimiento, tanto Yoongi como Max y los otros dos cantantes hicieron un gran trabajo"
Popular Opinion: Every ARMY is happy because YOONGI is back
"Suga arrasado como sempre,amei 🇧🇷😎사랑해 suga"
Escuchar a suga susurrar su nombre antes de rapear su parte es tan increíble.
Por que miercales esta canción es tan buena quiero que sea el himno nacional de todo el mundo
"El Máx demostrado que ama a Yoongi como a su hermano, tanto que lo incluye siempre... DIOS ES UNO DE LOS MEJORES ARTISTAS QUE MAS APOYO, tanto por su música y por su cariño a Bangtan 💜"
I hate people hating on Max for no logical reason at all! Real Armys will never hate on him! Let’s support Max as he has been soooo respectful to Yoongi and us Armys!
I'm happy to see Olivia here ❤️
AL FIN TENGO INTERNET PARA VERLO estado: líquido
Nobody. YouTube: let's send the Notification after 2 days😀 Me:😑💔
Lil mosey is the best part of the song🔥
"x: ¿y cuántas versiones haremos de blueberry eyes? max: si      edit: que quede claro que amo todas las versiones ahre. gracias por los l1kes, ahora soy un bities😎"
"Esta canción es buenísima, el rap de Yoongi como siempre es arte puro."
La parte de yoongo empieza con naranja y yo solo puedo pensar q lo hicieron porq a yoongo le gustan las mandarinas 😔🖐🏻aparte ese suga en susurro me dan ganas de vivir cuando lo escucho
post: suga will collaborate with max for a song armys: MUSICAL VIDEO TOGETHERRR YEEE video: ehm..nope armys: we want more! video 2: *suga's whisper* is it enough?  armys: yes.. :'(
Y yo aqui llorando porque yoongi no salio 😞✌
Popular opinion: Every ARMY is happy because Min Yoongi is back. ~Azerbaijani Army
Yoongus lyrics: « u ARe MY light » okay okay let me cry for a moment 😭😭💖
"Se imaginan que el yoongis hubiera cantado un pequeño pedazo de la última parte, en fin mi ilusión fácilmente"
Amoooo todas las versiones army hagan stream pleas ya no sean flojas votemos no cuesta nada (•°3°•) tengan dulces y a hacer stream.                >  > 🍡🍨🧃☕🍪🍰
Me sigue sorprendiendo lo bueno que es el rap de suga es de dios todo poderoso 😭😭😭❤
Yaaasss yoongi’s iconic little ˢᵁᴳᴬ before he starts his verse~
"Esta vercion es mi preferida.Max es increible como exprime hasta lo ultimo de esta participación,pero lo banco porque tiene una voz increíble y mucho talento para dar.Extraño a Yoongi!"
Siguen ahí haciendo Str3ąm a esta canción?? Vamos al menos alcanzemos el llegar a 1M!
"Max and Olivia staring into my eyes while singing the chorus, not knowing that my eyes are actually brown"
"Dios, nadie va a hablar de Olivia? Es q su vocecita preciosa la amo 🏃🛐"
How much funky aesthetic you want? Max: Yes.
So.. when are you gonna invite yoongi for a music video with him starring in it?
Obrigada por trazer de volta a voz maravilhosa do Yoongi
Essa música exala perfeição gentee
"Joder, Max canta hermosoooooo, al igual que Yoongi, es una combinación perfecta"
i love how he treats yoongi this is litterly such a sweet friendship
"Melhor música pra escutar antes de dormir(Se você for do Paraná, parabéns, está chovendo e isso deixa tudo melhor)❤"
Como se le hizo viral x la colab con yoongi hizo millon de versiones xd
Creo que los mix de esta canción se van a acabar cuando SUGA al fin se aparezca en alguno de los videos de MAX.😊😂
Sadly 2 things prevent Suga from starring in this video:  His shoulder surgery  The rule that all members must be in the video and that contract controls it
mosey is always a good feature
AL FIN TENGO INTERNET PARA VERLO estado: líquido
Vamos que se puede con el str3am !! Demos lo mejor !!
I was waiting for yoongi to say his forever iconic suga
"Estamos de acuerdo que el ""suga"" es vida jajhxjfjdjs ❤️👄❤️"
"oh, the “suga” before Suga’s rap was epic."
Okay but the part for yoongi’s rap reminds me of the namgi bangbangcon stage for Respect.
"Ho tanta perfección en esta canción, osea el rap de suga es todo lo que esta bien en el mundo"
If Suga writes a solo song I want would it like it to feature MAX.
Was this meant to be a comedy tho cause I was laughing my butty off The way yoongi whispers ‘Suga’ always gets me
"MAX really said YES, when they asked how much version of Blueberry eyes you want :) I'm living for it ^-^"
"PLS I REALLY HOPE THEY CAN PREFORM THIS TOGETHER ONE DAY💔 AND OMG THEY ADDED THE LITTLE ""suga"" BEFORE HIS VERSE IM SO HAPPY😭"
No se olviden de seguir haciendo stream a Dynamite
Just imagine seeing suga there with a yellow cube I-
"max is so cute and polite to yoongi, and you still give credit for everything, Max? count on the fandom army for just about everything."
"If y'all have a bit of shame and respect left, hype this song even a bit like you've hyped Savage Love and then went all mad when he didn't credit BTS.     MAX has been wonderful since the beginning and gives huuuggee respect to YoonGi... He can release as many remixes as he want... Even dynamite has sooo many remixes like never before  🤷🏽‍♀️   Edit :👀 dude...why does this have 1.1k likes? I never got more than 100 anywhere before. Thanks yaall... Let's hype ""Blueberry Eyes"""
hola voten en fanplus por yoongi en twt hay turoriales
How sweetly he treats Suga is wholesome. Thank you max
Mosey went too hard 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It would be a wild time to see all 4 of them in a room lol
Dónde está army latina? Me encantó la nueva versión♡  Señores y señoras hagamos tendencia ☆
Why no one talking abt Lil mosey part bro that was fire🔥
MAX THIS WAS SO GOOOOD AND I APPRECIATE SO MUCH THAT YOU LEFT YOONGI'S PART AS IT IS SO HE COULD ALSO BE A PART OF THIS VERSION <3 YOU ARE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HUMANNN
Escuche la voz de mi gatito yoongi y me relajee❤
ARMYS love Max because of the fact that he loves our SUGA too 💜💜💜
"MIN YOONGIIIIIIIII aunque no sales en el video, tu voz es hermosa."
Army its time to show pur power we need to keep streaming this as a thank you present to max for the way he treats suga lets get it army 💜
Can't wait to see Max & Yoongi perform together!༎ຶ‿༎ຶ
Al principio llegue aqui por Suga pero escuchandolos..ame la combinacion. Hoy hay mas de Max en mis playlist❤
"Remember RAGS I'm 11,i still watch it to this day with my cousins,its like an annual event that happens at every sleepover😂😂😂"
"MAX en verdad estima mucho la canción Blueberry Eyes ya que nunca la va dejar morir y es hermoso empezar este año con semejante joyita de canción, jsjsj todos de acuerdo que MAX es un gran amigo y fan de Yoongi, amoooo su amistad."
"I really love how Max can't forget giving creds to SUGA. We're here to support you Max, you're a part of our family"
I dont really listen to k-pop a lot but this is my favorite song
The voices are so sweet and honey-ish. OwO
"the perfect collab does not exist- THIS IS THE PERFECT COLLAB YES! MAX, LIL, OLIVIA AND SUGA !!!!!!! I LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT"
"The whisper ""suga"" before yoongis verses are the most iconic thing in the world"
Eu acho incrível q ele nunca esquece  do guinho 😔✊.
Max hizo Arte junto a YoonGi y merece mucho reconocimiento ✨💜  Max made Art with YoonGi and deserves a lot of recognition✨💜
The fact that we armys trust max with them✋🏻💜
yoongi te amo mucho aaaaaa

Jin and Jimin are jungkook biggest comedian fans😂🤣
"I think JK absolutely has the best sense of humor out of all the members of BTS.  He’s very quick witted and that’s why it’s so funny when he and Jin bicker - he’s got the best and fastest comebacks to Jin’s nonsense.  I love it and could watch it all day.  (And sometimes I do, Lol) 😆😆😆"
Jungkook's blonde hair is too much. He looks gorgeous with his blonde hair. Don't call him a dumb blonde even though he's a blondie now. hahaha
Jungkook being bunny   Jin laugh: 👁️👄👁️
I actually do think he's really funny without trying to be.
Nobody:  Literally nobody: Not even Kookie's blonde hair:  99% of the comments: *_Kim Taehyung Yoominkook's comments_*
They are a whole circus but the maknae leads the pack😂
"I know this is about jungkook but yoongi saying ""I'm an idiot I don't know anything"" when he literally described himself as ""min suga,genius these two words are enough"" is cracking me up so much😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Typical maknae gets all the attention and is being adored by his hyungs no matter what he does he’s the center of all hyungs attention
So the video is jungkook being funny featuring Jin laughing
"_ _*_Honestly JUNGKOOK  being himself._*_ _ _ _*_I love him so much._*_ _   _ _*_"" He is so cute and funny ""_*_ _"
Its Jin's laughter that follows for me...😂😂😂
"_ _*_when Jungkook cute and funny teases everyone to make their Hyungs laugh_*_ _  _ _*_"" Jungkook being himself ""_*_ _ 🐇"
"_ _*_Jungkook and his blonde hair so hot and handsome. Blonde Jungkook is here to_*_ _  _ ""wreck us all"" _ 😭💖"
"_ _*_Jungkook's heart : make everyone laugh_*_ _  _ _*_""Jungkook : what""_*_ _  _ _*_Jungkook's heart : do whatever you want because it's Jungkook_*_ _"
They've all got fun loving personalities that make us laugh especially jungkookie
_ _*_We will never know what is actually going on inside_*_ _   _ _*_„ Jungkook's mind „_*_ _ 😂❤
Jungkook jhope and jin are the funny one for me
"Lowkey? More like Highkey. JK, Jin and J-Hope are the funniest imo 💜😭🤣"
Jin's rap in the beginning 😂👍
Its so funny that whenever Jin’s in the room and jk makes a joke he is the first one to start laughing and he laughs the hardest😭
"yeah,he is even his hyungs have confirmed it when asked who they think is the funniest member..i assumed they would either answer either Jin or Jhope but to my surprise it was jk..."
He loves to entertain his hyungs
Me: Looks at the comment section *Kim Taehyung Yoominkook comments*
Our kookie is soo funny and cute💜💜  Me:laugh until you cry with jungkookie😂😂
Jin's laugh😂😂
Jungkook will always be Jin's child. ❤ Jin just always laughs the hardest at Kookie
"Jungkook is So cute, so funny🥰🥰🥰💜💜💜"
jin is always laughing the hardest 💜
*Koo : I do those moments to make my hyungs laugh . cuz their happiness is my happiness*
Jungkook is so funny and cutest ....if anyone is sad wacth jks video he can make ur day better wth his cutness and funny behaviour😇😇🤣🤣my angel koo😘😘
Common we knw coz he is raised by Jin Hyung
Even though I noticed that on 1:10 on that video Currently Yoongj almost fall down cause Jungkook making him laugh so hard I was a bit laughing also Hehe Such a Cute bunny Kookie 🐰 🥰
Jungkook is our bunny and golden maknae in his group.💝💜💝
Our kookie is so cute.
Someone save jin from jungkook's goofiness and save Jungkook from himself 😂
"I'm addictive to Jin's laugh, it is so adorable 🤣"
9:13 jk 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jin’s laugh is heard all over this video 🤣💜
The most love in my life is you ..... JK.      Pls be happy & still  healthy for us army. 🐰🥕🐰🥕🐰💜💜🙏🙏🙏🙏🐰
"JK being the maknae makes him the cutest member to his hyungs but when he throws in the jokes, silliness, and tantrums they just end up exploding with laughter. When JK makes a joke and nobody laughs Jhope: laugh at his joke! He's our maknae! lol JK is the pride and joy of his hyungs' and can do no wrong in their eyes."
Jungkook is so cute💜
its very funny when jungkook press the banana and it comes out
Lowkey??? He's funny highkey asf🤣🤣🤣💜💜💜
Jungkook as a typical center of attraction of family members...cute ni bunso.
JK: *exists*  Jin: *insert windshield wiper laugh* HAHAHAHA lol that's funny-
Jungkook🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No doubt he is very hardworking and tired much... Instead he always cheers up his hyungs...💜💜💜
JK...I have no words to discribe how handsome he is..💙💙💜
*EVERYONE GET READYY!!! Kim Taehyung Yoonminkook IS TRYING TO RULE OVER THE COMMENT SECTIIOONNN!!!*
Half of this video is Jins laughing 😂
Jin's laugh is what makes half these videos funny 😂
"Meet Junkook on any random day as a random person whom he doesn't know and has never met before and it seemed he has a reserved, cold, proud personality with a fragile ego as young men often have when they've become successful at a young age. Obviously he may not act this way with people he knows and lives with for long time. As a middle aged guy myself I didn't even call him oppa or hyung or tell him anything that I know him as BTS member. I just realised what we see on camera, celebrities can be very different in real life and may not be comfortable themselves except whom they really know someone for their own professional interests....Not going to a concert or fan event anymore nor waste my youth and time on wanting to meet celebrities even at promotional/business/marketing/social events...They are just regular people on a different platform. I'll buy and listen to their music and support them that way but nothing else anymore."
World wide funny guy ✨
2 minute silence for those who things Jungkook is a silent person only seeing him in interviews!!! XD
Omg Jk😂🤣😅😁💜
Your intro clip is itself the funniest 😂
Member are so happy at their fullest when maknae do something 😂😂😂😂
love you kookie
"That's why I'm SO into him!!! 😍 Plus his voice, his dancing moves and body. Jk makes My day"
Jin’s laugh makes everything funnier😭💜
jin and jhope Laugh is the more funniest
"No one : Me after reading the caption ""oh no jimin gonna die in laughter""🤣"
You infireses me... Saranghae My baby Bunny.......
How can someone be so adorable and cute awww Jungkook 😘🥰
Jin's and Jhope's laugh give me mental breakdown!!
Lord 🙏 ....Jungkook's cute smile can even heal people's disease 💜💜🥰☺️....he is truly the golden maknae of BTS 💜💜💜....and a **LOW-KEY COMEDIAN** 😂😂
"I still remember him saying ""it looks like a meal, but it's actually the part of the plate"" I was so done with him😂"
"😊Funny, cute at the same time very talented🤔 is very hard to match-up❣️ 1:29 very cute🥰"
Jungkook: Aishh!! Trustrated cute adorable bunny  Jimin:😂😂😂😂dying from laughter
"😂😂😂koookk is bangtan's kid,who laughs all that's jungbook"
Jungkook is indeed the baby of the group. The maknae that always makes his hyungs laugh
I love him so much
1:11 Yoongi's smile is everything😭🤧💜
This is how it shows that the bunny is the cutest🥺😹🥰
Jin's laugh is so beautful😭
Yes your cookie looks soo funny 😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣
Jin Jimin v are the most victims
I hear seokjin’s window wiper laugh in this entire video 😂😂😂😂
they were all funny that's why i like them so much they are my stress relievers
Jin really adores him
Jungkook is the Star❤️⭐🌟
It’s more like a compilation of Window wiping laughter 😂
i’m trying to focus on jungkook but all I hear this entire video is jin and jimin laughing hysterically and occasionally namjoon 😂
0:22   namjoon: I CANT UNDERSTAND   ME : he is acting  like that burger boy who came to his village for the first time and cant understand anyting   EDIT : indian and pakistani armysss can relate 😂😂😂
Oh dear I wish I stand in these videos🐰🐰🐰🐇💜💜💜
Jungkook is “lowkey” the funniest member? Lowkey?!! Clearly by “lowkey” you mean “obviously”
7:07  Yoongi being such a mood here 😂😂
I can't stand jungkookie's funny side and jin laughing at the background.😂
The title should be jimin laughing to everything jk does 😂😂
Jin is the biggest fun of JK and vise versa.
"Did anyone notice. When jungkook does anything funny, jin is always the one to laugh the most at his actions."
*Jhope: Did you see my bag? Did you see my bag? It's hella trophies and it's hella thick.*  *Yeontan: Did you see my Dad? Did you see my Dad? He's hella handsome and is hella cute.*

The members of BTS: Kim Seokjin Kim Namjoon Min Yoongi Jung Hoseok  Park Jimin Kim Taehyung Jeon Jungkook Kim Yeontan
Nothing diffrence between Jimin and Yeontan Cute-Both Long hair-Both Short height-Both Can attract girls fast-Both

"_ _*_""How to be Yeontan""_*_ _     _ _*_Hug, kiss and everything from BTS_*_ _"
"The thumbnail should be - "" Don't be jealous of yeontan 🤤😭💓"""
I wonder if Yeontan knows that his daddy and uncles are the best in the world.

DANCE is in JHOPE'S blood he proved it...

"*ahHh EccUse mE*  *_Even though we love Yeontan, deep down all the ARMYs are jealous of him_*"
Even Yeontan shares the visual appeal that V has.
Let's all be honest  We all wish we were tannie   And we wish we were v too so that tannie would be our child 🙃
"The caption should have been like ☟︎︎︎ ""Don't get jealous with Yeontan"" 😂"
I changed bias now it's YEONTAN my bias i'm so sorry JK🐰🐶
"Чимин ты если бы поиграл так с моей огромной собакой, то последствия были бы страшные..."
Tae in the background like: ya all stole my baby
"esse homem bb cute é tao lindo e com yeontan , fica irresistivel"
When the first time I see taehyung I fall for him as well as when the first time I see yeontan I fall for him I 💜 teahyung and yeontan
"And at that moment when the first showed Tannie as a baby, I knew I lost."

“jimins the kid who picks flowers during pe”
this whole episode was RM and jin helping the other members out the water and trying to actually be useful. Jimin is enjoying the show hugging everybody. V poor thing was just like the little boy who wanted to play with the big boys and was flailing around. Yoongi wasnt having any of it! and jungkook...well he was being jungkook! hahaha
"""Jk's thighs""  *same sis*"

Bts winning major awards vs Bts winning against Jungkook😂🤣 Their excitement is always on a whole different level🤣
"12:13 was actually even funnier, in behind the scenes they showed how a crew member helped jimin out from water but then jimin jumped in the water right after that again"

"thank uuu! please continue reacting to bts run! it's fun to watch you guys! :D oh btw you wont get strikes if you put your whole reaction to the run ep, only if you react to payed content. It's just that i wanted to watch your whole reaction! I'm sure many other armys would be delighted too! If you react to run eps starting from ep 86 up, please watch them on weverse since the subs are more accurate (maybe you already know this)"
Jimin why ur so cute
"I had to pause to comment:  Can we not , for a moment, NOT Appreciate whats going on right here in this picture: we have a mixed family, BLACK and WHITE, watching KOREAN artists: laughing and LOVING together; while us VIEWERS FROM EVERY PART OF THE WORLD watch and laugh with them~ I cannot not STESS this enough: THIS IS  AMAZING. THIS IS AWESOME in the truest sense of the word.  THIS IS MAY BE ONE OF THE GREATEST POINTS IN HUMAN HISTORY! AND WE'RE NOT DONE YET FOLKS!! WE CAN ALWAYS LOVE MORE! What an incredible time in history. The human race can overcome ANYTHING.   And my message had better not be misconstrued. Im saying right now, if anyone makes this message into something its not then the problem is with you, not me. This is a message of Hope. We know of the struggles out there -- please enjoy the global family we are a part of NOW  This video alone highlights the BEST parts of our nature"

esto es más falso que mi relación con Jungkook
"Cómo el/la creador/a del vídeo no dijo que es Fake lo haré yo  ✨ESTO ES FALSO✨(POR QUE HAY PERSONAS QUE SI, SE LA CREEN)."
Yo viendo como suena la intro de Big Hit
soy la unica que vio como jimin abrazaba a Tae
A yo pensando que era verdad 😞
es mas falso que escuchar a namjoon decir que le gusta el chocolate con menta
Nadie   absolutamente nadie  Ni un alma.   Mi mamá: porque se tratara tanto bañándose  Yo: *tirada en la regadera descalabrada por andar bailando bichota*
yo mirando a nanjoom
Si no ma cómo es  editado ami me llega la notificación de ellos
tae me representa jajajaj
La carita de hobi
Beautiful love you mis papis bellos💖🇩🇴🇩🇴🥰
Todas las reacciones de BTS Officiales salen en canales de noticias o en Bagtan tv.Otros canales como este es puro Fake - Falso No se confundan Armys.
"Ya se que es falso por que obviamente ellos no reaccionaron a esto si no a su canción DINAMYTE  Esto es mas falso que mi reacción con, tae we pero de igual manera te quedo bien 👌"
Todo por tener vistas haces we🤣🤣 FAKE🤡
Soy la única loka que se creía que enverdad relacionaban a estás canciones
"Uno hay una cruz hereje  , en el mv de bichota , :""( esto es iluminati xd  , por otra parte , esto es falso , este no es su video , >:("

Es la primera vez que escucho esa canción completa . Y me preguntó si les pusieron los subtítulos jajajaja  Que oso con esa canción
Traducción de ellos lo que dicen en español si van a ver videos latinos
Yo imajinandome que  bts si estaba viendo el vídeo de bichota osea si se que es falso pero me pregunto en algún momento habrán estado por youtube  y habrán escuchado esa canción osea seria cool que un día si reaccionen de verdad a canciones latinas

"BTS :*doing vlive for years now*   Also BTS at the end of almost every vlive: ""hOw dO i tUrN tHiS oFf??"""
NAMJOON REALLY SAID ‘congratulations 😐’ PLTHSHSHAH
"""how's DTS? sorry they're dead ts""  I WHEEZE EVERYTIME"
Baek: my shoulders are actually very broad when im not wearing a shirt V: can you... show?
Taehyung was straight up Wilding on the latest Run episode.
"my favorite bts moment lately is namjoon's iconic  ""Are your legs tired cause you're running in my mind? oOoh!"""
Random people: *BTS is ICONC*  ARMY: *ICONIC wants to be BTS*
Jhope: So who's out?  Staff: YOU  Jhope: 👁️👄👁️              *Shocked Pikachu face*
V: There was a blackout jn **continues to explain his theory** Jin: One of the staff turned off the light by mistake V: eye twitching 🤣
Taehyung: **overthinking things** Theorist ARMYS: **welcome to the club mate**
"""HOW do i turn it off "" - a never ending saga"
They been doing Vlives for years now and they still don’t know how to turn it off😭😭😭
I’ve watched BTS videos more than I’ve seen my friends in quarantine
haters: I hate bts because they're iconic. bts and army's: why you hating outside of the club when you can even get in?
"i swear- every single vlive they always fall for the ""you cant close one eye and put one finger on your cheek"" comment  every. single. time."
Everything they do is iconic at this point.
"""aren't u tired, cus ur running in my mind?"" namjoon's expression i-"
"""how was your dts? sorry, they're dead ts"""
Joonie just taking his time to perfectly peel the potatoes is so damn adorable I can't-😭😭🧡
"V: *Everyone focus, focus*  RM: *confused af*  V: *There was blackout just now. The ARMY headstone was destroyed after the blackout...which means-*  Jin: *no, aniya.* *One of the staffs, accidently formed off the lights by accident.*  V: **eyes twitching in disgust**"
Namjoon and that hair...simply killing me. He is so handsome.
jungkook’s will to win at the detective game is so funny 😂
Jungkook: why did you scoop so little? v: i heard you are on a diet mr.baek: *shhooookk* .....     im dead 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was finally faster than Suga’s rap ✨
"""So it's all edited. You seem so good in the show"" - Mr. Baek 😂😂😂😂"
"In one run episode V said: ""I'm better then namjoon in cooking"" The new run bts the chef says: ""Are you learning how to cook rice""  V: ""yeah?"""
"This kid is going places and I was expecting more sophisticated questions than this, got me 🤣🤣🤣 loved it, thank you"
Yoongi at 3:53 is me ALL THR TIME IN CLASS 😭
"The last time I was this early, kook was 16"
3:47 HIS FACE AT THE END THO- 🤣🤣🤣
"3:53 PLEASE YOONGI LOOKED SO DONE - HIS GLANCE IS LITERALLY SAYING ""can u stop talking or is that not an option"""
"""Sorry they're dead TS""  HAHAHHAHAHA I'm WHEEZING"
4:22  Namjoon be like: Why we still here just to suffer every night-
you just had your breakfast... congratulations...
Namjoon telling us sweet dreams and night night is so cute 🥲🥲
I can already see someone naming their band “✨Ducktan Sonyeondan✨” in the future :D
"V : ""May I have your autograph?"" RM : ""I want yours too"" Such a cuties 😭"
"NAMJOON SAID ""Sorry, they're Dead TS"" I'M LEVITATING AFSGSFAFFSGAGAGWA"
I didn't even watch the full vid and I know this is going to be chaotic lmaoo
Other ppl: omg taehyung change SOO MUCH AHHH  Meanwhile Taehyung in the that run ep: 🎆 w i l d e n 🎆
The Namjoon peeling potatoes 🥔 edit was hilarious 😆😅🤣
Namjoon's dimples manage to give me existential crisis every single time....I don't even know how I survived till now
"Never ending saga... Bts: ""how do I turn it off??"""
"Namjoon was literally like: ""oh you just had your breakfast? Ok..... Wut do you want me to do?"""
"""ARE YOUR LEGS TIRED BECAUSE YOUR RUNNING IN MY MIND OOO""     (HELP)"
"Namjoon bit the inside of his cheek several times, I'm just-"
Popular opinion: BTS FANDOMS are the luckiest 🍀 fans in this world 💜
suga’s expression at 3:54 LMFAO
2:07 lol jungkook looks so proud when the chef complimented his dish his face 😂
I HAVEN'T DONE MY REPORT AND ASSIGNMENSSS AND SCIENCE PROJECT YET AND WE HAVE AN UPCOMING QUIZ AND EXAMS NEXT WEEK BUT I'M BINGE-WATCHING.  **Kim Namjoon wants to know your loaction.**
Omg 😳 namjoon saying “ bye night night” 😭😭😭
The clown energy was so high for Tae on the run episode 😇
My latest favorite line is Namjoon's Dead TS 😂🤣
"Kook's face at 2:09 is hilarious like omg XD  Uh oh, Namjoon is now a huge bias wrecker for me bc I watched the Persona MV.....*swoon*  Anyway, hello Army Mama!! I hope you're well! I am writing this comment from my brand new laptop....which means  I will be uploading better videos andddd I'm getting a new usb mic tomorrow!!! I'm so excited, I'm on the road to being a real BTS/anime Youtuber!!!!!!"
"4:00 Namjoon's ""Oooooo""..He is so cute..☺️💜"
"After so many Vlives, why do they still not know how to turn it off? Lmao. Every time they're done, they're like 'how do I turn this off??'"
Tae saying kook is just copying mr.baek too😂 regarding the eggs
"when joon said ""congratulations"" he looked so done istg-"
When the chef said “so it’s all edited”- lmaooooo
Life advice: don't sit on the corner of the bed while watching kookiestaetas awesome videos💜🙂  Not saying I fell off the bed I- nvm-🤡
The breakfast congratulations killed me when I watched the vlive 🤣🤣🤣
"They have been doing V live for years , but still don't know how to turn it off 😂  They are soo precious 🥺"
1:56 online class be like OMG HE SAID GOOD NIGHT AND SWEET DREAMS OMGGGGGG IM SLEEPING GOOD TONIGHT
Tae: Explaining about his thinking about the blackout Jimin: nah one of the staff turned off the lights by accident  Tae: O.o
"Pfft, pleasee! Not even a minute in, I'm eating my brunch and then Namjoon just congratulates me for eating breakfast. I can't even.... 🤣"
''how is DTS?''   namjoon: ''sorry they're Dead TS''  PJSHWHSHSHAH
Alternate title: ARMYs staring at the screen and smiling like an idiot for 8 minutes and 4 seconds straight.
Namjoon ignoring the butts question vs TXT having an all-members-on-deck Weverse argument about it in the middle of the night lmao
✨ I C O N I C✨ indeed.
Idk but your intro gives me the fEeLs~
did hobi suddenly get like 10x hotter in the past few months or am i tripping
Lmao Joonie really went Congrats xD
""" hairdresser jhope. what is this? did you use this tool to destroy the headstone?"" "" its a blowdryer.""  PLSSSS"
2:05 = me to literally all my teachers during online learning
"Hobi : ""Is this really a tablespoon?or is it too much?"" Mr Baek : ""I expected more sophisticated questions""  Me: Well its BTS you're talking about so...you are literally with babies...."
V : amazed by the rice he cooked Jin : Mr. Baek poured the right amount of water! Also Jin : The rice is made by the Rice Cooker!!!! Meanwhile V :  - _ -

BTS knew jin is still a baby ㅠㅠ
"The fact that he only got 16 birthday messages and still smiled and said ""You guys are the only ones I've got"" goes straight through my heart."
Jin: only 5 people wished me after 1am and 16 in total when i woke up in the morning  Armys who filled social media with wishes for jin since 12 at night:👁👄👁 wth!
"BTS every year for each other’s birthday: cake, sing happy birthday  Jin: I didn’t expect this"
SEOKJIN FANS  👇
No doubt JIN is the “happy virus” of BTS
Lol when I was a baby army I thought Jin was the second youngest
"Jin counting the number of texts he got for his birthday and army is just chillin like: okay, Rude, But I still love you"
"Noone : Literally noone: Jk: it need to show his age ,29..😂😂"
Its basically Jin is their baby and how they give him all their attention
HOW MANY INTERNATIONAL ARMYS Fans are here?  👇️
Jimin: Why do I keep hiccuping? Me: Still a cute baby Mochi.
Jiminie showing his love to Jin is the most endearing thing. We need more of Jinmin.
JIN FANS 👇
Jin: Only 16 people wished me  Meanwhile ARMYS: Flooding the WHOLE INTERNET with JIN
Omg Jin's face when Jimin pulled the string on his hat had me dying 💀💀
Jin: Yeah it's my birthday today  Age: Jin: what  Age: 👁👄👁
OMG JIMIN IS SO CUTEEEEEEE AAHH WHEN HE KISSED HIS FINGERS LMAO
"I showed this to my grandfather, he said Jin was a middleman."
*DÓNDE ESTABA YOONGI... PORQUE NO APARECIÓ AUNQUE SEA EN FOTO... DÓNDE ESTA YOONGI!!!?~~ ':3 :'3*
First JIMIN held Jin's face then he even kissed his hand at the end!  AISHHHHH THEY'RE SO CUTE 🥺💜
JK was very determined to make birthday cake for his jin ..he even burn his hand
"Jin's smile is soooooo cute☺ Also Jungkook, v Jimin, Rm, suga, jhope🥳"
"Please Lets cheer him up, i just couldn't believe how sad he was on Vlive for His birthday, it really broke my heart watching him acting that he was ok but His eyes said another thing. Please support 💜"
2:44 Jin wants to break tie with Jimin and he just kissed Jin's hand LOL. Too adorable:)
"Jin is such an amazing person. Wise, mature, yet full of great sense of humor!"
"Seokjin existe: Maknae line: besable   Me pone tan feliz que sus donsaengs cuiden de él, es el mejor hyung y su amor es recíproco ♡"
Tranquilo Jin por si te sientes muy viejo en Korea recuerda que en MEXICO todavia tienes 28 JAJAJA
JIMIN KISSING JIN'S FINGER OMGGGGGG M CRYIIIIIIIINGGGGGGGGGGG
"Jk helping in preparing the cake for his Jin hyung is just so touching although they are the one who bickers a lot, they all love the eldest it's heart warming to watch 🤧"
How many international fans are smiling when Jimin kissed jin's fingers  👇
Pobre jungkook no se si reírme o llorar 😢
"Wonder why Jimin disclosed few people sent birthday message to Jin in this celebration event and in the air? especially he know his hyung felt sad about it, its not fun at all.  Appreciated Tae tae asked his friend to send message to Jin, this guy is so warm and is an true angel, and J-hope, thumb up, love u guys."
Jin is the oldest of the member in BTS but he's so cute😙😙
Jin: only 5 people wished me after 1 am Armys: *this guy cant be more serious*
"2:45 The way Jimin kissed Jin's fingers, I can't explain the unconditional love & the softness of this moment! So precious!"
He is like a little boy still now and he likes doll a lot in this age.😇😇😇😇
"Jin always cheat when it's about age , he seems getting older but cuter"
So cute when Jimin kisses Jin s fingers  they will be friends forever wish I had friends like this.
You know what warms my heart it's seeing them care for each other even just the little things gestures  that they do just like how Jimin touched Jins chin. They truly love each other and that's what I'm here for. I know my boys are fine
"This isn't just a boy band, it's a whole family."
No one :- Literally no one :- Jk :- I want to show his age😂😂  He never misses a chance 😂😂
Is anyone a Jinmin shipper here.
Fun fact Jin’s birthday(December 4th)is the day after my birthday(December 3rd)
Jinnie ❤️
2:44 Jimin dándole un besito a Jin 🥺 luego de golpearlo 😂💜
Jin is so talkative 😂😂 cant help make his boys laugh on his own birthday
Lo que le hizo jimin a jin hasta a mi me dolió jajaja mi video por ultimo le da un besito en las manos que cute <3
"JIN you make our lives better💜 You really can't see how many lives you've healed???? Your voice is spectacular, full of emotions and praised so many times. Come on boy!!!!!!🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺"
What is the point in surprising him on his birthday when the entire world including Jin know that 😂
"I tell you, Seokjinnie just keeps getting younger ;)"
"No one:  Literally no one:  Me:Everytime that bts members birthday,blowing thier candle, preparing their cake,and surprising them,the first member that always there is hobi😊💜"

"Bts is already the best family living on earth; ) we army fans don't need proof : ) they help each other during hard times, they enjoy etc. These things only family will do!!!"

We really dont need to proof that BTS are family coz they are already a cute family of 7 members..😊
BTS is part of my family because they have helped and made me happy in difficult times better than my family🥺😭❤️💜💜💜💜 yes  BTS is a big family with ARMY 💜❤️🤩💪🏻🥰😘
J-Hope is sooooo caring to everyone
"BTS is not just a band, it's kind of a  world filled with love, affection, understanding and many more❤️❤️❤️"
We don't need proof they are a family 💜
Imagine in place of jimin  you  will be setting and jk is waving at you ❤️😭
Not only BTS is a family but this whole fandom (including myself) is a big family who will always protect and support BTS and each other no matter what CHEERS FOR BTS AND US ARMYS! :)❤️
"Yes, they're real brothers even though they haven't had the same parents. Bang Si Hyuk, the owner of Big Hit said that they should act like real brothers at their dormitory all the time 24/7. So they've been living in the same house though they've gotten great fame and popularity in world pop markets and that's what they wanted. BTS boys' brotherhoods are the cause of their perfect teamwork and fantastic stage manners as they showing their amazing concert. So nice video."
"Jin to Hobi: i love you bro; you know?  A R M Y 'S: we all know that "" Y O U   K N O W""😅😅."
"Can we just remake old McDonald song in this way -  Bts here , BTS there  Bts bts everywhere"
"The 7 of them, who is from different areas are destined to meet at bighit and fate brings armys and bts as a family too.. Wow, fate can be so amusing at times too❤️"
Jin is such a caring hyung to BTS.. 💜
Thank you someone’s who understands that they are a family not boyfriend like we are not the ones to decide their sexuality
I love my life My life is BTS....
BTS is a beautiful family who always love and care about each other. They always consider everyone's opinion before themselves.  *I purple u BTS* 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
The thing is jhope u'll never forget them became you'll always be together forever
We love you BTS keep safe
OH MY GOSH WHEN JIMIN WAS WAVING HE LOOKED SO CUTE😭💜
"Oh so everything now makes sense..as Jin and RM being the mom and dad of group, Suga being the grandpa and Jhope is the aunt or uncle who spoils his/her nephews...a big happy family 💜💜💜"
"Jin has a habit of saying ""u know"""
Jin and sugar are talking like mom a he's kid
The only thing I am proud of being a fangirl is that I have been an army since day one.. and I take pride of it. we have been a family since 2k13.. and will continue to be one forever. borahae My army family
Brothers from different mothers. Brothers by heart. OT7😭❤

4:22 This will forever be iconic!!!! ❤️❤️❤️  Ahhhh my heart 😭😭
Unlike other Korean group artist they really have become a family and despite of differences they are willing to cope up with each other and get their bond and love even stronger. New Army here. <3 <3 <3
I just love watching these types of videos before I go to sleep 😴 💜
"It's so emotional. The way we love them, they love us back too. I mean they cry on the last day of their tours. Because they can't see army❤️❤️❤️"
I also wanna see them with their kids and wives in the future. Love this family
I can see kookie giggling behind the mask when jin was telling yoongi to do good at rehab 😄😄😄
Jin is a caring boy
Every moment is precious ... but 5:21 hits differently for me 🥰🥺❤️
BTS fantastic  7 members & 7 superSTARS ❗👈👍👌✌
In a world full of infinite people a family of seven which makes us laugh without even doing anything as well as making us cry for just being themselves ❤ So proud to be the part of this generation 🥺
watching this made me realize how much BTS has grown and it breaks my heart because they're growing toooooooo quickly

Como me gustaría probar la comida de JIN PUES se ve deliciosa💜💜💜💜💜💜💜🤘😍😘
I love their relationship with each other ... and it is stronger than my relationship with my family or friends in general ... I hope they stay like this forever💜🌍💫
Yes BTS is a family and Army's are members of their Family Purple you Army's and BTS 💜💜
8:49 when jimin was giving thanks to his members it made me so emotional 🥺
"J-hope is so precious I can't even! (They all are, but there's something special about the way he expresses his love and affection.)"
This video actually was try not to cry challenge for real Army 💜💜💜
I have always seen their cute and cheerful side since last year And suddenly doing such Behind The Scenes made me so sentimental and feel they r humans too but are perfect
I think this is one of the reasons why BTS is so successful. They are truly brothers to each other.
I literally sobbed when Jimin was thanking the other members 🥺🥺😭😭 Bangtan family 😍😍 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"when he said “I love you bro, you know” MY HEART IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE 2:08"
Seven children having fun and staying together.🥺💜
"I like when jin say ""I LOVE YOU BRO, YOU KNOW"""
Jk: I am not good at comforting....     Me: I see your photo whenever j am sad 😘😘😘
At 3:34 when Tae was talking about his grandma and  the way Jimin came to him to comfort him was priceless😊😊 Jimin is always our precious Angel❤❤
Tae casually confirming that Joon has kids
"Completely unrelated but when txt said their concert was cool jungkook hyung was flying in the air jungkook said ""Yeah i almost froze to death"" i just can't--"
This is why Jin don't have friends.
It’s so heartwarmingto hear them saying that they wish they could be together for a very long time.
Never forget BTS editor will always put a cute baby chuckle when Jungkook do literally anything XD
All members of BTS are so supportive and very helpful to each other And love each other so much  That makes me wanna cry Love you BTS  Borahae💜
1:00 this was the cutest fall I ever seen 🥺🥺🥺🥺💜🥺🥺💜💜💜💜
This is a gifted group.. it's rare to see all members are so much in love with each other.
BTS means a believe and trust in each other....💜families learn from them how to take care of a family....💜I hope BTS always will be like this💜💜
사랑해요💜 I LOVE U 💜😓 NAMJOON🐨💜 JIN🦙💜 YOONGI🐱💜 HOSEOK🦌💜 JIMIN💜🐤 TAE🐯💜 JUNGKOOK 🐰💜
I want them to always be together and happy.
"Doesn't matter how many muscles he has, he is still our Kookie."
Jungkook is Always BTS's and ARMY's baby 😍😘
"Jungkook is so lucky to have 6 precious hyungs like jimin, namjoon, taehyung,j-hope, suga and jin... ♡♡"
Wht is juliet & romeo ? We only know kookliet & jimeo 😂💜
"1:26 So yeah, Jin can carry Jungkook few years ago 😂💜💜"
Jungkook is our cute little bunny
"JK is still a kid, so he's needed care from elder members, honestly. However, when BTS's direct junior K-POP boy band ""TXT"" came to the choreography room of BTS to meet them, he acted as if those younger boys' big brother. To be honest, he is not an elder member. But other BTS elder members saw his cute action with smiling faces at the time. LOL"
Jungkook bunny smile is Just everything 😭
ANNYEONGHASEYO JEONUN BANGTAN SONYEONDAN HWANGEUM MAKNAE JEON JUNGKOOK IMNIDA!
"Earlier, I couldn't fully understand why they all love JK so deeply as one would love their child or a real sibling.. and why he loves them back so too n behaves like fav of all...💜❤️🧡 But now I understand. Cz he is the one who was added n handed over to them in his early teens when he would have all the mistakes to make due to teen's over confident self but less knowledge (as he himself confessed) ... BTS boys n staff have seen n helped him grow into a very hardworking, talented, adorable n made wise by them adult showering all the parental love towards him..  understanding during the time that he would be missing parents' comforting care badly during his growing years.. They all practically raised him... N have done their job even better than many a parents.🎩🎩🎩 @ 15 he was just a child.. i specially adore the clip where while batch is present at JK's graduation n he is being such a shy teenager. . Many parents don't give importance to such events in their children's lives.. n some are mis- fortunate for various reasons to not be able to. I keep falling more n more n more n even more in love with BTS everyday.. n m learning a lot from them with everything I get to know abt them.. 💜💜💜💜 Not to forget, major part of their such goodness is surely their management seniors n staff..so lot of respect for them n much thanks also for setting a good example of management being success while keeping human standards of humanity high 👌👏👏👏 I 💜 BTS.. Kookie u grew well👍💜"
**Jungkook flips over dramatically**  Jimin: Why'd you flip over?? O_O  Jungkook: That's normally supposed to work... if I do it while running owo  You've gotta love Kookie 😂
Debut days: Jin lifts Jungkook  Now: Jungkook lifts Jin
"""I could be a manifestation of all their characters coming together"".... this is amazing.  The members, in their own different ways have made a huge impact on JK."
"BTS are the best family JK could have ever asked for. Knowing he was so young and introverted, they all made sure to take him under their wing.  He is truly blessed to have met his hyungs who have over the years have taken very good care of him. They protected him when they needed to, gave him love and affection, taught him right from wrong, guided him through life and were supportive every step of the way. JK will always love and appreciate his hyungs and everything they have done for him. He has turned out to be a wonderful, kind and respectful man who every hyung had a hand in raising."
1:23 back when jin can hold jk 😅😅
Jungkook u have no idea how ur bunny smile blow armies day.... 💗💗
"BTS is blessed, but Jungkook is beyond lucky and blessed"
9:46 this birthday I will always cry about. He truly felt so bad and they were so good at acting.
Everyone have a soft spot for JK 🥺
I’m soft when suga was just listening to jk and giving him advice is so cute 🥰
JK 💜 He's lucky 2 have brothers like BTS 💜
"Jeon Jung-kook is like a reborn baby, beautiful and delicate, cute and cute, he is our baby, BTS took good care of him and will still take care of our kookei is and always will be our little baby"
Jungkook is our baby💜 He have 6 hyung and army  that love and support  him soo much😊💜💜
Jungkook will always be a baby for the members... and for ARMY💜💜💜
Jungkook is the brightest star to be born 💛
"Kookie is precious,kind,handsome,cute, Delicate, multi-talented...only one jk in the world...💜💜"
1: 26then: elder Jin carry youngest cookie Now: youngest jungkook carry  elder jin😂😂😂 Every action there is a equal and opposite reaction 🤣🤣🤣
"I know nothing about him before he came with Savage Love Tiktok and I begun to search information about him coz this dude impressed me much, how come such a young Asian boy singing English so good while he keep pain inside his heart.. since then and knowing his past make me more n more love him, my first impression was right. I always support you JeKay ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
Bts is everything for us 💜💜 Love bts 💜 💜

CUTEEEE BUNNY.......
I love you jk and bts💜💜
"their relationship is so heartwarming , I see these clips all the time and even after all these years they take care of him just like when he was 13 and he takes care of them so well , nowadays he clings on to them a lot and they give him a lot of love and care, he doesn't close himself too much its nice to see such a healthy bond they dont pamper him at all but they are there for him when he needs them and ofc there is respect all around but no strict hierarchy  and jungkookie growing up so beatifully mind wise, body wise, brain wise is a testatement to his hyungs love and care  jungkookie's good personality reflects their actions over the years, it really shows  3 yrs back koo said that he is influenced greatly by them , i see it now , every hyung's personality is embedded in kookie  from a psychological pov its very interesting to see and its even more amazing to see how jungkookie proudly blatantly talks about his hyungs alwasy being there for him and the same vice versa and how he has become even more cuter than before and clingier T_T"
"The clip shown at the end is very nice and very adorable 😘❤️ BTS and army loves jk forever even is gets older , married and having kids we love you a lot kookie 😘😘. You are so precious for BTS and army 💟🙂 saranghe oppa 💜"
"Ugh when he cries, I want to cry.."
"Suga is so handsome here, when he was talking to jungkook."
"1:27omg I've never seen this clip before.....its so sweet. It seems like a k-drama scene, but bromance lol 😂"
We will always love u Jungkookiee💜💜
JK : the members all towards me Ahhhhhh💜💜💜💜🐰
so who tell suga is a cold hearted person? you know what he's not. he actually a warm hearted person he showing his love by action and letter's because he's not a showi person
Jungkook is very lucky to have his hyungs all these years😀😀😀
Hobi:jungkookiee...our pretty jungkookiee Me;yaaaaa
I wish I had such ppl in my life too
He's soooo loved by all his hyungs.. It's so beautiful to see how they love and take care of each other... 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"Jungkook thought he was a frog inside a trash can when he first came to seoul and met other talented people, but now, he is the king of the world!"
I'm so jealous of jungkook  I don't even have friends who take care of me like this  Jk is really very lucky to have them Even though i feel happy for him 😊😊😊
Aww They all care so much for Jungkook. They all came a long way to become a family. I call them Lucky Sevens. They are a family not friends. Love BTS Forever!💜  💜💜
The way the care about is more than a family. It’s awesome. And that is the most addicting part of being a fan
When jk doing flip step nd he don't complete it then jimin said *fighting* 🤘💜💜💜😘❤❣ Lots of love from Indian army's  #fighting
It’s amazing how these men can openly show emotions and affection to each other. It’s just so healthy and refreshing to see.
"JK always be our cute, little baby bunny😘😘😇😇"
yes we know jungkook is precious especially his bunny smile💜! but did anyone noticed the guy's hoodie at 1:59💀
"No matter How much he'll grow up , he'll be still a baby for them ..."
"You know, it’s really amazing how much has has grown. I wasn’t there when they were just rookies. But Jungkook was a kid. A kid who left his childhood to pursue his dream. It was probably really tough for him to leave home and his old friends (if he had any, I don’t know) but still...that’s a lot to ask from a kid. He grew up well. I’m glad he has good people around him."
I cried too much rewatching the video 😭🤧
*thats why we can see every members glimpse on him*
Jungkook is so lucky. He has great awesome friends. Just like family to him. I want friends like them. And I love jungkook very much. Army from Sri Lanka 💜💜💜💜 Love u BTS..... 💜💜💜
Jungkookieeee u will always be our babieeee no matter how old you get❤️❤️❤️❤️
I like J hope hes so cool and kind and sweet
6:39 I cant manage to see this without tears in my eyes
ITS SO NICE TO HAVE SIX HYUNGS LIKE THIS .  Jimin - loves him more than his real brother  v- break his shyness  Rm- reason we get JK  Jin - make him laugh  Suga - Always gives eternal support  jHope- Learned how to be positive at al situation     BTS - the reason why he is good at everything
A manifestation of all their characters coming together.. Wow
Is it only me find JHope's voice cute whenever he speaks in English? 😍😍
I like how bts treat Jung kook as their baby
"Es muy sensible JK me hizo llorar!!! Es un ser de luz , muy buena persona 🥰🤩💜 hay que tratarlo con mucho amor y no decirle cosas que lo lastime 👑🐇✨"
"I love BTS,I love Jungkook,and I love how BTS protect each other! Army love u,Tysm for making the start of our 2021 much better!🤍💖"
"The ""kookliet""and ""jimmeo"" did it for me dude,🤣🤣🤣🤣 especially when they said it in _tiny_ , Lmao"
"BTS is not just a boy band, its a family, its an emotion ♡♡"
"Their relationship with each other is so beautiful and inspiring, you can feel the genuine love. This is what makes BTS so different."
JK is still the baby. But long ago he proved his love for his brothers.  These seven men will always be remarkably close. They have worked so hard it’s crazy. They respect and love each other; it’s great that they enjoy the admiration and they have together!💜
He really is a baby to his hyungs .... how preciously they brought him up....🤭❤💜
JK IS SOOOOOOOO LUCKY  TO HAVE BROTHERS love him N TAKE CARE TO HIM LIKE BTS I STILL LOVE BTS AND JK MORE N MORE  N MORE NTS MY EVERY  THING THEY  MAKING MY DAY OUR DAY ACTUALLY ARMIES PROMISE ME WE WILL LOVE BTS FOR EVER  N STILL ENCOURAGING THEM FOR EVER 💜💜💜💜🔮. I PURPLE YOU KOOKIE 💜🔮. JK IS STILL  OUR CUT LITTLE BUNNY  . 💜🔮.
I was just going awwwww aweeeee in this whole video😭😭😭
new name fo jungkook kookliet
Golden baby jeon jungkook 🤧🤧
They all just so lovely boys..such good boys....and they did a good job of raising Kookie
"in korean age its 15 but if u actually think about it (he joined in 2010) so he was just 13 or even 12 if it was before his bday  he literally started his teenage years working in an almost bankruprt company following a 16yr old and being surrounded by 6 elder hyungs despite being a shy and quiet child T_T i sometimes even shudder to think about it but ofc tannies influences him every bit positively (he is really a manisfestation of all of tem 100% true, he says it a lot too and he knows what he is talking about) but other than that i think he is a really brave kid for choosing such a path and sticking with it , it gives me strength to even just think about it"
Oh my jungkookie🥺aish everytime he cried it made me cry too💜✨
He really grown up so well before he was shy but now he is the most  confident one Thanks to bts to grow him.wellll
They are not just a group but a family .love u all brothers 💜💜💜💜
It was so cute 🥺. I'm not crying now 😭😭😭. I swear to god I'm not crying 😭😭😭😭
Being an army i feel like hungkook is my baby too..lol
Junkook worked so much hard😭😭😭 and now he is satisfied 💜💜💜💜 because of six hyungs 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 very lucky guy
Hyungs are lucky to have such a talented maknae and Jungkook is lucky to have such good hyungs. And armies are lucky to become a part of that family
kookie is so sensitive.....and he is so lucky to have friends like that
Thanks for BTS to teach jk many things 😁 Their youngest member is golden
"they are like a family. fighting each other, taking care of each other, and making fun of each other just like closest brothers"
First time I saw jin carrying jk 💜
Jungkookie's  speach made me cry😢....I love u 💜
But i think bts doesn't treat jk like baby or maknae nowadays.. I don't know why i know they still love him...
I really want to hug kookie right now 😢😢😢😢
"These young men embody such good and pure qualities, how could anyone  not like them ❤️"
The warmth in my heart right now...Hyungies and ARMY's Baby forever🥺!
"Jungkook is Army's kookie and yaa! also mine☺️☺️ the way he smiles, doing wierd things, imitating his hyungs I love him doing these things ❤️❤️"
Hi Jk is our cute bunny 🐰🐰I love Jungkook and bts so much 😍🥰
this compilation basically dominates jinkook vibes
They take care of Jungkookie.. They are a family no one can break/replace them
My always Fav Kookie bunny 😘💋💜💜
Jin used to carry kookie before but kookie carries him now 🥺

"fuh, finally im watch this on time!"
Jungkook is everyone's baby❤❤❤❤❤
"Kookie felicidades a pesar sectu corta edad has sabido salir adelante en todo lo que te propongas, mantente saludable, un abrazo grande"

"JK is ARMY, Bangtan & Staff baby 🥰"
Jungkook still a baby for every army💜💜🥺🥺🥺
Thanks to these staffs who take care of my euphoria :)

Es como un bomboncito de chocolate que te quieres comer por lo dulce que es😀😍
♥️♥️As long as they feel comfortable and happy♥️♥️nothing matters♥️♥️
Who deserves the biggest house?💜
Respect his privacy. This is exactly why he has to keep moving.
Jungkook deserves it
"that's his private life, leave him tf alone"
"I hope the new house address doesn’t get leaked. With Everybody making a video about it and giving so many details, some people will end up locating it"
I hope you guys realize that koreapop literally just leaked Jungkook's new house! and then had the audacity to talk about other sasaeng fans that did the same thing. ur poor idols! no wonder they live in a place most popular for idols because it has privacy!! 😭💜
istg-they all are multi millionaires  but they still decide to fight  for ramen
Fun facts: BTS don’t even have enough time to live in all the house they bought :D
They don’t have enough money compared to the billions they have generated.
He's gonna sell it for more than the price he bought it for. Jungkook is a business man lol. Hobi hyung is a great influence. So ya'll can set all the drones and track his house on google maps but he will eventually find his ultimate private home that nobody will ever know about. Stop wasting your time.
Everyone is first until they refresh their page
Jungkook is so Lovely and has a high fashion sense I really admire him and I want him to be happy and live a very good and happy LIFE💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 Love you Jungkook💜💜💜💜💜💜
And the fact he did this all in just at the age of 23 amazing.
Jungkook is the richest man
"Initially, I thought that it would be interesting to see what Jungkook has down after selling his first apartment. However, when KoreaPop has gone so far in using maps, drones, illustrations, and innuendos about the exact location, distance from their luxury dorm, and the indications of the actual complex house AND THEN . . . .  shouts down stalkers, I began laughing. KoreaPop wants to authenticate its own surveillance and huge stalking vibe by attacking potential ARMYs or anti-fans by declaring that ""THIS is the way to Jungkook's house. ""Check our channel for all the BTS locations!! One-stop stalking info to help you find the correct neighborhood.""   Seriously, KP!?! You think this is ""helping"" to protect the privacy of idols? Curiouser and curiouser . . . . ."
Good luck to him. He's worked so hard for it all. I hope he's very happy in his new home & I hope that his privacy is respected there.
Jungkook home is near Indian embassy. OMG... I am freaking out of my mind. Kookie I hope if someday he notice India  individually 💜💜🇮🇳🇮🇳
We should all accept that our kookie is still young but very wise💜
All members deserves house like this (✿ ♡‿♡) THEY ARE IN MY HEART EVER
Ya jungkook deserve it 💕❤️😍😍😍
"they even deserve my pocket money which is like 27$ and they get like 16$ of my pocket money.Mom give me more money, please"
He's sooo rich😱........but still he's sooooooooo cute😘😊
The most valuable thing in kookie house is his refrigerator .Because he loves to eat !😆
"JK has ever wanted to get a house that nearing BTS's dormitory because he wants to see his family members if he has a chance. So he bought that house, which means he needs attention from his family."
He deserves everything the biggest cutie 💙💜💛  I wanna see him in real life 💛💜💙
and still fight with his hyungs for a gift certificate. love this human being
"KOreaPop, could  you, please  leave  them  some privacy??!!They  don't  deserve  leaking privat information. Let  them  be, at least at  their  homes, safe  and  secure."
this is why he keeps moving. y’all don’t respect his privacy.
"Jungkook, the sold out King 👑"
"Good luck for new house hope it will  become his home ,stay healthy  BTS 💜 ARMY"
May be JK wanted to give all the best  thing in this life for his family..👍👍👍
Big Congratulations to this hard working young man all members work so very hard and deserve whatever they want what i love is BTS members are so humble peace/💜
"Working so hard, you deserve it JUNGKOOK!"
Jungkook mon bias mon prince 🤴❤️
"He doesn't live there. He probably bought it for investment purposes, because this house has been rented out to someone. Jungkook lives at the dorm."
"What a good son,I'm sure his Parents are very proud of him,Jungkook he knows how to invest the money and he's very young ,love you Golden maknae"
wow im the third viewer :o 💜💜💜💜
"how u gone say ""privacy for kpop idols is top priority"" then not even a sentence later, spare not a damn drop of confidentiality of this man's whereabouts. your business must be closed because you're sure not minding it, speaking from a pissed-off perspective 💁🏾‍♀️"
I have goosebumps y'all but Gookie deserves it💜
Our kookie is priceless! 💖🖤
"I hope him the best, he really deserve everything he worked hard and never had something for free. I!m so proud of my little baby💜🍓🍓💜 And please stop giving info about his house and stuff like that, he deserves a little bit of privacy, it's suffocating to always be under everyone attention"
JK is my ultimate bias... so thanks . 🐰🥕🐰🥕🐰🥕💜💜💜🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Not me watching jungkook having all these expensive things in my small apartment.
"yay he is more closer to Indian Embassy   I hope one day a piece of news will come ""BTS is coming to India"" 💜"
"Yes my little king, get that property, get those square metres. Also please can I come stay when international travel starts again? Lol."
JK deserved the BEST💜💜💜
probably bought as his family's rest house. well deserved TT
happy for him he deserves the best 🖤🖤
JEON JUNG KOOK 💖💖 you deserve this page I wish you all ways wounder full profile ❤️❤️ and beautiful singer life 🐰🐰😊😊😊😊💜💜👼🙂🙂
Jungkook deserve it 💜
Love BTS! Greetings from Tricity in Poland 😘
The golden maknae 💜🔥
He should not be giving out their information on the in the internet or sasaengs will stalk him or maybe watch his every move pls be careful jungkook🥺🥺🥺🥺💜💜💜💜
"Awwww. Good for him. Hope he enjoys his new mansion. It's beautiful, but he has worked hard for what ever he wants. Just want him to be happy and safe....💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
I'm just happy for you junkookie😊😊😇😇❤️🇵🇭🎉
Jungkook in thumbnail is looking through my broke soul
"For me money dosent matter . if jk was not in bts , not rich, not famous , I love him as I am now"
well deserved for jungkook. i pray for his unlimited success and happiness. he is our ❤️. i love everything about him including his purchases 💜
Our baby deserves it 💜
"He definitely deserves it, but I hope nothing gets leaked and his privacy is respected"
How did I not know jungkook owned all this!?
"Happy for you, and you deserve it good luck always jkookie😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇"
Jungkook is just my love dream 😳
Why would you want to invade his privacy like that .. uploading this this video will give his sessangs  an idea of where to find him and that can be dangerous for any artist ..
That’s what hard work does. I’m so happy for him! 💜
He deserves it after all for his hard work☺️😚❤️
The security is so amazing ..there is no way that fans can get in. And if you think those are actual pics inside of his apartment...get real. They are not!!!
Oh my love wish you more baby be yourself 4ever and be happy💜💜💜💜🐰🐰
he is very special and multi talented. . he is a blessed soul. love him ♥️♥️
Isn't Itaweon too crowded tho? I guess he is young that's why...
"Lol! New Car, New House... baby JK got his own baby! Hes growing up!❤"
My question is how do u know where it is when Jungkook didn't say🤔
He is a King and he deserves the best place
Best decision to buy his own house to invest for his futures life. He deserves it.
Jungkooki  Tu folloving  dream.  People love Tu. I love  boy
He's so good as king that i can't find my amber blossom downy anymore T-T
"💜👉oh i heard that before a man wud settle down in SKorea, it is a custom.to buy a house for his wud be family. Cud it be that he's planning to settle down wd V? Theyve been silent about it tho im one of those who insinuated, lolx!  Even BigBang's Jiyong purchased a $12M home b4 their planned wedding wd Dara this yr."
"He is rich , because of his hardwork , he really deserve it . I 💜 u ."
Gooooo kookie he deserves it🥺❤️❤️❤️
Live a long and happy life Jungkook 🐰
Jungkook deserve it💜💜💜🙂
Jungkook is sooooooooooo rich
Jungkook many Congratulations for this
Congrat sodra yamam mo in joy Jung oki
That’s insane 😎 I guess he works hards. 🤪
DOES HE WANT US TO SEE HIS HOUSE....ORRR HE DOESN'T.what if he bought it because sasaengs knew where he lived and he might not feel comfortable if people keep telling where his house iss
I wish him nothing but the best. I hope he can stay grounded. It’s easy for that much fame at his young age to be too much. That goes for all of them.
"Even though they have their own houses, they still have their multi million dollar house they all stay in together."
I the first one in first time love your video its informative  💜💜
Jk really likes to keep himself personal.. And he doesn't like to share  and express his personal life story though he express himself about the love he has for armys... Every member said that he is introvert guy... And I am really proud of him... He buy a single home just bcz he don't want people around him and he can live in his house peacefully with his family or him only... So I didn't liked when news mentioned his address and home
JK 💝
Give them some privacy... It's so much helpful to them and they deserve it   That's all I want to say 🙂
House Party 🎉 lol
Congrats jungkookieee❤️
He deserves it Please stop showing where it is it's actually really dangerous for the members you're actually putting them at risk cuz toxic fans will go after him and that puts him at risk  of getting hurts or someone else getting hurt
You deserve it 💜💜💜💜
"His house is smaller than mine and cost a heck of a lot more LOL My house in Korea would be over 10 million probably or more. It is one story 5 bedrroms, 3 full baths, and 3,000 square feet. My bedroom is 550 square feet and my bathroom could easily put 25 people in it. Here in America my house is only $300,000.  BTS members are worth between 50 - 100 Million USD so yeah they can afford it and houses/cars are investments. Many of their homes are investment properties, flips or tax write offs."
This is why idols keep moving homes/apartments because people keep giving out there location🙄
I never been this fast💜
Saya da terjumpat seoul koera k.pop
"this is mixed with ‘love is a bitch’ by two feet! it’s not actually on any of the 50 shades soundtracks, but like it definitely fits the vibe haha. jikook come in at 1:30 if you want to skip to their part! personally their verse is better in my opinion because you can't hear the residual instrumental of 'who' as much.                       ─── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: .☽ . :☆ﾟ. ─── i also uploaded this to soundcloud for those of you who may want to listen to it there! → link: https://soundcloud.com/planetaerium-youtube/who-x-love-is-a-bitch       also this was inspired by @/pleutoh's yoongi edit that uses the song 'love is a bitch' on twitter! please send their original edit some love on twitter [ https://twitter.com/pleutoh/status/1353057778265255942?s=21 ] or on youtube [ https://youtu.be/EDMttX2n5aE ]!"
WHY DOES THIS SOUND SO FUCKING GOOD THO?
the fanfic in my mind is screaming now
This is basically house of cards pt2 soo good !
this was a song about a person who can’t recognize his girlfriend as the same girl he first fell in love with but now it sounds like smth you’d here in a wattpad fanfic and i live for it
Just imagine Jungkook dropping a song like this in his mixtape with his beautiful low voice 💀no comment.
I want this mix in my funeral
i've never watched 50 shades of gray but I think this sums the whole thing up
if i ever play this song at a party i won’t hesitate to swing my hips in slow motion and show them kiddos what i got 🌚
"Seokjinnie woke up and choose "" 50 SHADES OF BANGTAN """
i want my friends wearing latex and playing this in my funeral
Ok but this is dope-
if smutty wattpad stories had a theme song:
house of cards who? I only know seokjinnies masterpiece
This is making me feel some type of way I shouldn't.            *Bodyroll intensify*
I just literally listened to Love is A Bitch...then this came out😳 This is a Masterpiece✨
"MA'AM THIS REMIX IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL‼️After listening to this, I'm just blinking and gaping like a gold fish, trying to get hold of what I have heard and wondering if this is even possible to bring 2 songs together and make a art piece worth placing in a museum. Please- your brain is ✋👁️👄👁️ just HOW-"
don't fall in love don't fall in love don't fall in- 00:02 shit
"Well, now I will put this song when I’m reading wattpad lol"
"If this doesn't get play while I'm walking down the street on the rain feeling like a boss, I refuse to live."
*sad twerking*
I CLICKED ON THIS SO FAST. AND IT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL!!! So fitting to listen to after I read a new chapter of a bts mafia fic I was reading earlier
Your creativity never ceases to amaze me. Ty for blessing our ears with your beautiful mashups🥺
The only dislike is from the person who was vibing so hard to this that they accidentally disliked-
"We shall call this song “Who is a bitch” 😂  Anyways, amazing mashup as always :)"
one second in aND I AM LITERALLY ON THE FLOOR-
hi this is gonna seem crazy but i'm pleutoh.. from twitter^^ thank u so much for crediting me i really appreciate that!! i don't even know how i inspired such a cool mashup i'm speechless honestly?! i've been enjoying ur mashups for a while but u surprise me everytime this is absolutely Amazing wow !!!!!!  ++ if anyone sees this comment i just wanna say the yoongi edit is better quality on yt cuz the edit looks real pixelated on twitter lol ☆
god i love “love is a bitch” and “who” is basically what got me into bts. in heaven rn
im absolutely in LOVE w this mashup. this is the mashup we all needed and wanted 🤩🤩
THIS HITS DIFFERENT
"If these mashups aren’t played at my wedding, I ain’t getting married"
"Waah, I was just listening to your playlist I made :)  AMAZING AS ALWAYS !  Heheh, I'm first."
This song will be perfect for listening to when you're in love but it feels sad.
I have a feeling that this is gonna blow up
"ESTO ES HERMOSO, ME ENCANTA MUCHO, SO. 😭👌"
when the morning comes you're still in my bed…*flexing* 🤠
PUTA QUE PARIU!!!! ESSA PORRA TA MARAVILHOSA MISÉRA
Why tf you are so underrated we live in an unfair society ✊😔
jungkooks voice is angelically sinful
It didn’t even start and I love it
MEU DEUS ISSO TA INCRÍVEL MANOOOOOO🥺💜🥺💜🥺💜🥺💜🥺💜🥺
*when the morning comes you're still in my bed*  Me: *chokes*
this needs to be on spotify or else i’ll throw a tantrum. and i’m not kidding LMFAO.
I kinda have a feeling this gonna blow up among us hard stans 😏
i think i may have listened to this an unhealthy amount of times now...
I live for this ✋😩
"Amo con todo mi ser esto, I love it🎀💓💓💓🎀"
When jungkook was singing “get in my head “ I was like “get in my bed”😂😅😂
Que hermoso video 😍❤️
already know this will be gold!!!
"These two songs individually are amazing, but together: STUNNING"
PUTA MERDA QUE PERFEITO NMRL QUE RAIVAAAA
do I love who by jikook so bad? yes. did I listen to it more than anything in this life? yes. do I adore this version? absolutely. did I cry? oh man indeed. am I going to listen to it million of times and cry more? certainly.
"Alright but hear me out guys I just got goosebumps, this is too good I'm always amazed by your skills!!"
PQP ISSO TÁ BOM DEMAIS
PRECISO DESSA MÚSICA NO MEU SPOTIFY PRA JÁ!!!
"Jungkook's part managed to get me pregnant, I'm not even kidding"
The only bad thing about this is that you made me OBSESSED
jikook's verse hitting different here
da ganas de perrear y llorar a la vez ＞﹏＜
this makes me feel some type of way that i cannot describe but l do know that this is fking amazing :3
"Jungkook starts singing and I feel like I am floating,,, BTS main vocalist  is on outwardly level."
Man...I left my test just for this and I am not regretting to leave my test ~~this is so awesome 😭😭❤ .. keep making video liks this 🥺🥺😭❤
THE SOUNDTRACK WE DIDN'T KNEW WE NEEDED💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏
ok but imagine adding in ariana grandes vocals for dangerous woman into this alternating between both songs chorus just imagine the power that would hold
I just want to dance this song in a pole seriously
"Pied Piper X the neighborhood, pied Piper x house of cards, and now this !! Such an insanely sexy mash-up omg 😳"
"I'm in love with 7 korean man, I'm in love with  voices, I'm in love with a Mashup. This isn't ok..."
BRO I FELT THE BUTTERFLIES ALL OVER MY BODY THIS SHIT IS SO GOOD
"Genuinely can't stop listening and singing to this song. Out of all the collabs, I think Lauv and BTS is the best."
YEESSSS we have another mashup for the queen herself and omg how dis you make this sound so good
I feel like i can see myself dancing to this...even tho I have 0% experience in dancing
PQP- AAAAAH Q COISA PERFEITAAAAAA😍🙌
I didn't know I needed this in my life until now
"Esta canción en su versión original me pone triste, pero en esta versión me pone mood bitch ✨"
why tf does this sound so epic!!!!
"if perfectness had a sound, it would be this.."
Who + Love is a bitch= PERFEIÇÃO
IF IN NORMAL SPEED THIS SOUNDS VERY GOOD YA'LL NEED TO HEAR IT IN 0.75 SPEED-
nobody:  me: makes up fake y/n scenarios before going to bed 🦋
"Mds, que perfeição 🛐🛐"
1:30 the best part when Jungkook starts singing ❤I am addicted here.
I will literally pretend to make out with someone against the wall to this
This is a masterpiece 😫💕
I never expected this mashup to be THiS soothing.
At first I thought that this is gonna be a fanfic
"It gave me goosebumps, pls help me i am dying over this."
THIS IS SO COOL OMG
Put this on Spotify PLEASE I BEG YOU
When you feel like you want ur mood to be sad but house of cards come to your mind:
This made me feel things to my soul
"How.....HOW CAN YOU MAKE SUCH GREAT EDITS?! LIKE SERIOUSLY, HOW?"
"WOAHHHHHHH Seokjinnie, u nice keep going!"
"I heard this, now I can die peacefully ☺️☁️✨"
This is definitely going to on my favorite mashups list
This song makes me feel both heart broken and turned on... Congratulations ig
This is like a toxic relationship but also filled with lust. They keep coming back but in the day time they know it’s unhealthy
jikooks part hits different
Lol not me smirking the whole time 🤦‍♀
everyone will be dancing this in my funeral and you can't change my mind :))

NI-KI LIE DANCE COVER WHAT?? •᷄ɞ•᷅
The fact that he's just 15 years old and he can confidently dance this masterpiece
I honestly didn't think anyone could pull off 'Lie' other than Jimin. But Ni-Ki really popped off. He is such an amazing dancer
All I'm waiting for is for Ni-ki to do a dance with Jimin and then my life will be complete.
"Dear Belift, please promote ni-ki in studio choom artist of month. His dance skill are no joke."
My bias is Jimin and I swear Ni-ki is giving off almost the same vibe as Jimin does when he dances this. Maybe because he's not just dancing but is also feeling the song.
Niki's hair dances too!😮
"Ni-Ki best dancer, Ni-Ki enha ONLY main dancer, Ni-Ki prodigy, Ni-Ki 4th gen best dancer, Ni-Ki the future of kpop"
"I knew who enhypeen was before because of iland but this is what actually made me started stanning them. It takes a lot for me to like bts covers especially dances and when their by jimin becase that man control and the way he moves is beyond me. But I can go on about that for awhile  lol anyways Niki did an INCREDIBLE job covering this and my respect for him is so high. I already respected him as a hiphop dancer, but this is something else."
"""Ni-ki best dancer"" isn’t an opinion, it’s a fact"
Cant wait to see Ni-ki ventures more on his dance style. Hip hop dance Ni-ki is so cool and amazing. While Cotemporary dance Ni-ki is so beautiful and soulful. May he continue to be passionate in showing all sides of him ✨
NIKI IS BEATIFUL
踊っている間息をするのさえ忘れてしまうくらい見入ってしまう迫力と桁違いなダンススキル。 ただのコピーでは無く、今の年齢のニキ君が感じ取ったオリジナルの 'Lie' でした。 でもそこには絶対的なジミンちゃんへのリスペクトがあり、ニキ君の魂が込められたダンスだったからこそ多くの人に伝わり賞賛されたのだと思う。
Ni-ki best dancer
I seriously can’t believe how naturally talented how Ni-ki is
"WE MADE IT! 2 MILLION YES! THIS LEGENDARY COVER DESERVE MORE, LET'S WORK HARD ENGENES!"
Ni-ki best dancer ♡♡
Come on niki show them who is the dance machine in this parts
What amazes me is that this was so Ni-Ki but at the same time kept Jimin's essence like.. idk how to decribe it other than BRAVO Ni-Ki
"Out of all the people who covered Lie, Ni-ki is the only one who nailed it."
"Niki: Energetic, powerful Jimin: Elegant, emotional  This two are great dancer!"
Nishimura has swallowed all the talent of the world..  I'm so glad I stan ENHYPEN
NIKI's hair is dancing too!
Ni-ki is AMAZING
"notice how he didn't lose the original elements of the choreo but at the same time kept his own style,that's a dancer,I stan talent"
"I’m I the only one that’s very HAPPY seeing all the Japanese comments supporting our babe, even tho idk what it says :("
JHOPE + JIMIN = NIKI
Ni_ki the best dancer
"Also guys, can we please stick to calling him Ni-Ki, please always include the -   it helps for his brand rep.. and for new fans to know how to spell his stage name pls"
Ni- ki is the standarad you all...... I just saw jimin's performance and came here.... He is really giving the same energy jimin gave on stage while performing this..... I am spellbound😍😍😍
I’m not going to stop rewatching this until we get another Ni-ki dance cover
単に音ハメしてるのではなく、身体から音が出てるようにしか見えない。 そして0.5倍速にしても、どの瞬間で再生止めても身体のラインが美しい。すごい体幹だね！感動
NI-KI definition of dance prodigy
Jimin’s lie is one of the most difficult choreographies to execute and ni-ki did so well. Jimin would be so proud
"Me: Bruh I’m not going to simp for another man I’m satisfied with Jimin  Niki: Ow really? Then stop watching my dance cover, you’re watching it 1 month straight"
"Okay, now I'm hundred percent sure that Ni-ki is my bias :))"
he executed this amazingly
The fact that his dancing skills are so good that his dance cover is literally on another level. I can literally see a younger jimin in him :)
"Imagine ni-ki and jimin dancing 'lie' together, indeed a powerful duo. PERIOD."
B E S T   C O V E R!!!
NI-KI BEST MAIN DANCER IN THE WORLD
My Riki nailed it❤️
"Woah Ni-Ki legit gave Jimin vibes and this is the best dance cover for ""Lie"". Periodt."
Beautiful dance👍👍❤❤
ni-ki is only 16 years old but he dances like a professional who has been dancing for 50 years. he is the best dancer of the 4th generation.
ni-ki has dancing in his blood
"I love how his movements are really sharp, clear and connect to each other. Maybe it's just biased but I love this cover the most."
Hello this is Ni-ki's wife everyone. I am here for about 100th times now. See you. BTW I miss Ni-ki so much rn. Please post something Ni-ki 😥❤
Ni-ki is honestly terrifying. He should not be this good at dancing at 15. He’s insaaaannneee
Niki you are perfect boy
Dance legend
talented riki💖💯
NI-KI I LOVE YOU!!!
"I’ve been an ARMY for almost five years now, and I have never seen any dancer come even 10% close to Jimin in all this time. This kid really did PERFECT justice to the song and Jimin’s performance. Proud is an understatement. I’m saying this now, and I’ll keep saying it again. Ni-ki is going down in history as one of kpop’s most legendary dancers."
Ni-ki's style is clearly visible with the power😵😍🎧
He is the BEST DANCER I ever seen sorry but that’s truly what I think and it will never change cuz no one can beat him he just GETS BETTER EVERYDAY!! :)
there are two who are dancing 1) NI-KI 2) His hairs
最近ENHYPEN知った私、K-POPアイドルのレベルが高いのは何と知ってたけどNI-KIくんは異次元というか、神秘というか、動く芸術、、。 一瞬でオリジナルの空気作るし、吸い込まれるし、永遠に見てられる。
"The dislikes are because people were so shocked by Ni-Ki, so they missed the like button with their finger"
NI-KI I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!!!
He has a sense The rhythm And adjust the movements It is a nice
ni-ki's dance is ART...he keeps the element but adds his own touch to it....so amazing
Who can dance this song as better as jimin....niki can....army support engine....
Plot twist: Jimin personally taught him the choreo and his right in front of him watching.
"Seriously, I cannot imagine enhypen without Niki 💜💜💜"
Nikiの記念すべきこのdance 動画に私も一言残したいと思った。何回も見たくなる…  世界中のファンがこれからも ずっとこの1:43秒を心の記録に焼き付けたと思う。 一流の芸術をありがとう❣️
15歳でこの表現力はすごすぎる‥ 五年後、十年後、今よりどう進化するのかが楽しみ KPOP、ゆくゆくは世界でダンスうまい人といえばNIKIと言われる日が来ることを祈ってます！
髪の毛にも神経あるんか？ってくらい頭の使い方が上手い
NI-KI: Visual:100%        Talent:100% Personality:100% And that's our ace maknae
Ni-ki best boy!
Riki our best dancer!
ok now i need a special stage with jimin and niki
一回見ると、一回で終わらない。。 何回か繰り返して見てしまう🤭✨✨
I’m a bts stan who biases jimin and I can literally say this is THE best cover of lie... I’ve seen several different people try and attempt to cover this song but they never truly get it down right.. but niki? He executed it amazingly. There’s a reason why people call lie the ‘rite of passage’ in Korea and Niki did excellent.
もう何回視に来たか分からない。来ずにはいられないこの中毒性。 そしてまた来る🏃 Ni-ki最高❤️
Jimin will be proud of you niki
"I've been dancing for 6 years and i don't Stan kpop completely, but I watch them, and listen to their music. For 4th generation, I think this boy is the best, on this age he can surpass many dancers. and for the girl its chaeyeon from izone(?) (sorry for dragging other group member or if I say her name wrong)  Completely opinion though"
"I really shookt,,niki is only 15 years old bruhh😭😭"
NIKI DANCING TO JIMIN’s LIE?! ITS A WIN FOR US ARMYGENES
2M for ni-ki
Amazing job Ni-Ki
I like his sharp moves.. wild energy
ニキはダンスが上手いのは分るけど、グループで踊ってる時も雰囲気が柔らかくていい感じ。
No one: Literally no one: Ni_ki: *Let's kill army´s and engene´s with a lie dance cover*
冗談抜きで毎日来てる。
NIKI ATE THIS UP OMG I WILL FOREVER WATCH THIS COVER
Im 📌 addicted 📌
ITS BEST COVER IN MY LIFE WE ARE SO PROUD OF OUR NIKI
ENGENES AND ARMYS: NI-KI AND JIMIN: Let me serve you a dance that you’ll never forget and take y’all breath away
This is the best cover I've ever seen. 🔥🔥
NIKI'S LIE DANCE COVER REACHED 2M VIEWS!!!
"what’s really good here is,, he is not just dancing but he’s feeling the music, he’s adding his own flavor in it,,, look at his facial expressions  bro, dAymm he’s so talented ✊🏻"
anyways ni-ki best dancer
POPULAR OPINION: NI-KI IS THE BEST 4TH GEN DANCER
Nishimura Riki 4th gen main dancer!
ダンスのキレがすごすぎる。 そのキレに逆らえないサッラサラの髪の毛が好きすぎる。
Happy 2M views💗
"His movements were precise and clear, abounding with emotions and energy. Damn. I can't decide if this' really but a cover or what. This is beyond great."
We need collab BTS x ENHYEPN NI-KI x JIMIN 👇 who with me?
ニキを見てるとk-pop界に革命を起こしそうな気がしてなんか期待してしまう✨✨✨ 新星が出てきたってドキドキする💓 ダンスと普段のギャップにもまたやられてしまう😍 これはもうニキの沼にハマるしかない😇😇😇

"I just got on with this video, and I can assure you that you have made my not-so-good day improved by 100%.  There are two reasons, the first is that I am a fan No. 1 of JUNGKOOK, he is the reason that I have become A.R.M.Y  And in 2nd place because everything you showed had good taste and he is adorable and sexy at all times.  I still can't get over the puppy thing 😂🤣😆😁😃  😍🤩😘🤗💋😏🤤  I would feel just like him puppy if he decides to do that in my presence.  Thank you, I really enjoyed it."

"""you don't want to study?"" *you can see how much he wants to give a whole ass speech but is holding himself back*"
Bts when they're alone: makes sashimi and is able to cook for themselves for a week Bts with a chef: help me MR BAEK
No one:    Joon: My hair is blue and grey   Also Joon: WhErE's mY AnGeL
"""are your legs tired? Cause you're running in my mind"" LMAOO ARMYS YALL SO FUNNY I DIED"
"Namjoon's Vlive was chefs kiss, this man is so funny without even trying istg"
Bts in k pop industry for more than seven years and still they don't know how to turn off v live ☠️☠️  We stan legends😂💜🤚
namjoon admitting that he broke the snow duck maker is so cute 😅
I got one: You can’t spell Arms without RM😏😏😏  Also there is ALOT of comments that say: you can’t spell army without RM so don’t bother commenting it😄
I clicked like my life depended on it
no one:  not a single soul:   jk: ti Ti ti Ti
RM's humor is everything
"namjoon, sweetie, you're doing great."
rip dts. you will be missed.
No one: Literally No one: Jungkook: RRRRRRRap monsteRRRRRRRR
No one: Literally no one: Not even jungkook’s cooky pouch: Jin: The walls are creating an optical illusion  Me after reading the subtitle: Yes they kinda are
When u realize that most of the video was about RM.😂
Army: **askes namjoon abt mint coco** Us: yes/no Namjoon: **gives a whole speech**
"I remember the live, someone said : *I just had breakfast* And Joonie just said: *Congratulations* 😂💜"
_ _*_Jungkook : Im the oldest in BTS_*_ _  _ _*_5 minutes later :_*_ _  _ _*_Jungkook: iM sTiLl YoUnG sO....._*_ _
The last time I was this early jungkook was still rapping-
when have the boys NOT been funny tho-
Namjoon is a whole mood😂 “DTS is DeadTS” 🤭
Damn last time I was this early jimin was still taller than Jungkook
"""You don't wanna study??""  This is literally a cry for a 2021 performance of Pied Piper"
No one:  Not even hEy sToB iT: V: can you eat 8 hardtacks in one minute? Taehyung: Can I have your autograph? Also v: He is on a diet Also tae: will you take it off?
"No one : Literally no one : ARMY : ""One butt *vs* Two butts?"". Joon : ""👁️👄👁️."" (LeGiT bEiNg DoNe WiTh ThIs FaNdOm)             ""I'll think about it at home.""🤦🤦🤦  #SaveNamjoon  (edit) LMAO. God bless our president-nim , he's always so much more patient than he needs to be and tolerating all our nonsense...We appreciate you Namjoon-ssi!😘💜"
'Are your legs tired cause you are running in my mind ?'  This pickup line 😂😂 LMAO 😆
I cracked up at that one butt vs two butt questions lmao. Believe me. The whole night j was thinking abt that right after watching the vlive😂
joon being fooled by armys for acting cute is peak comedy ..!!
Namjoon is funny and have great sense of humor and sometimes Armys won't get it lol.
"No one   SUGA-swag, sWAg,swAg Swaggg"
1:10 I didn't expect anything else from the king of destruction😂
But the way tae was being a whole cutie pie at the run episode with Mr. Baek
I swear i was in a language zoom class then out of no where namjoonstarted making these loud noises and i almost got yelled at 😭😭😭😭
"When he said ""they're DEAD-TS"" I lost it😭🤚🏾"
*SnOw mAkEr wAs oUt Of OrDer i JuSt bRoKe It* ah yes namjoon being the king of destruction once again i see
_ _*_Jungkookie's bunny teeth smile is the cutest thing ever_*_ _
"I was gonna go to sleep but, Screw it.  I got priorities 💅🏻💅🏻"
His reaction to the pick up line is the cutest 🥺💗
namjoon is the cutest
The title is literally words of God.
i love the way yoongi says swaeg swag swag
Mr. Baek: My shoulder are wide when I take my clothes off Tae: *Are u gonna take them off?*  Girl I- 💀
Who is that Disgraced person who disliked this video? Love you Bunny swag 🥺🥺🥺🥺🖤
The recent run episode was just Mr. Baek being *done* with BTS :)
"I started stanning them beginning of 2020 after I watched the carpool karaoke video their humor is literally something else in every good way lmao. I fall in love with their music every single day I discover more of their discography, seriously bts has one of the best discography. I’m a huge music person and I have never really seen as much versatility in other artist music as I see in bts, they can seriously pull off so many genres and they all have such different voices to bring to the group. I understand why they are so huge and loved by so many people. Their success is definitely deserved💞 :)"
"Title: ""BTS is their name, being funny is their game""  Me: ""BTS is their name, being crackhead is their game * windshield laugh*   Also just wanna say the QUEEN is back, I missed you bunny swag, lots love from me 💜  Edit: I also really want to just finish my exams and work hard on my channel, maybe learn something and work on my beauty cause I'm worldwide beauty gurl 😉💜"

"JK and his ""rrraap mostaa"" will never get old"
"As soon as I saw the notification, I clicked on it 😂😂😂"
The chef praised jungkook cooking skills he was so happy
RM trying his darndest not to break a potato is the funniest.

2:58 Jin's cheeks look so squishy here I- 🥺
namjoon talking abt mint chocolate is like a university's representative for MUN talking in front of many countries 😂
no one :   namjoon : i just broke it
namjoon is such a mood tho

I have never ever been this early sksksd 💜🥰
"1:57 Nooo, not the "" I will think about it at home."" lmao"
Okay Namjoon you are doing good. Baby steps.....baby steps. You took one now tell take another. You are going good.
RM is lowkey a really  funny guy
I like how RM said the snow shaper broke. Like passively. As if he was not the one that probably tore it asunder lmao
no one : Yoongi to jk : Your toiletry bad is cute
You can’t spell menu without me so does anybody want to go to McDonald’s-
Presenting BTS our daily dose of happiness 😂💜💜
I love how they always do the Imperial March tune in dramatic moments like this 3:18
I love how Joon holded back himself and controlled himself for not giving a whole damn speech on studying😂💜
Bish i was smiling like an idiot through the whole video and my mum thought i was texting someone lmao-
"1:41 i swear- idk what it is about that ""oOoOo"" but i just find myself watching it over and over everytime-"
todos recordamos la escena de nam pelando papitas en bon voyage
Fact - love  can't be spelled without V  Fact 2 - people watching this love BTS a lot (like me) :)
When your sad because you like mint chocolate but you also like Namjoon.
"*RM'S ""OOOOOOOO"" S KILLING ME HELP* 1:39~1:43"
I cant deal with jungkooks cuteness-
"No one's talking about jungkook's  ""Ti ti ti ti "" was so cute aww 🥺😍💜"
1:38 that was the cutest froggin' thing I've seen in my life 😭
"My favourite line from Kim Namjoon is probably   *""Are your legs tired cus you're running in my mind?""*  *""OoOoOh""*"
I started laughing soo hard and my dad was giving me the look and then ask me if I am an idot 😂
"*Chef's kiss to THAT title* 😘 Pls, u deserve an award for this iconic title. 🏆"
Namjoon yes Namjoon can wink with both eyes I--
"When BTS gets hurt, millions feel the pain"
"“I usually eat rice if it’s there, and I don’t if it’s not.” Sounds logical to me."
"It’s true what Kookie said.. “When try to speak, tears always come out first” 🥺"
I love the fact that Jungkook always shows how he's really feeling rather than hiding it. 💜💜💜
Jungkook was so young when he has debuted and after so many hardships he has achieved all this he and now he is responsible and mature.....He is completely full of talents his vocals and dancing skills are really amazing he is our cute kookie.....💗💗.....We armies love him so much our love for our cute bunny can't be measured....💗💗.....
the baby is so delicate :( his 6 big brothers and millions of who love him and the boys will always be there with him.
Jungkook cries if he's asked that is he crying and ARMY cries if they see Jungkook crying 🥺😣😣 ☹️😅💜🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️
Army we have only 200million views for DYNAMITE left and then we have 1BILLION! Keep streaming!! You don't have to stream if you are busy please or have studies :)
Jungkook looking hot even when he's crying Then there's me: the ugliest potato 🙄😂  (No offense 🙊)
He can be adorable and hot...... *the duality is driving me nuts*
Im like jk because when my freinds says that are you crying and i burst in tears you nkow im a crybaby just a little joke i starting to tears
"Jungkook wears his heart on his sleeve, hes an emotional & sensitive guy. And he is so adored by everyone who loves him, like me. I'm his biggest supporter & always will be✌❤💛"
There’s always a reason why I love this channel
i just want to scoop him up and tell him everything will be okay. *pats him on head *brushes away his tears
KPOP CRUSH : **How BTS members make jungkook cry in 5 seconds**   ME : **Going to the refrigerator to get banana milk🚶‍♀️**
"Well cutie maknae his hyungs must be really proud,he might be mature now but he is still the baby of BTS and ARMY's."
I hope Jungkook and the guys never have a reason to cry :))
Me : ( sad ) Mom : are you crying  Me : ( starts crying) 😭😭 I'm not joking this is what happens to me after I fight with mom
Not being afraid to show his feelings and soft side makes him even WAY MORE irresistible😇😘😍💜
"3:40 I hope that too, also I hate when people ask me if I’m crying as well"
Jk you’re a human like us everyone make mistakes sweetie🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
"Crying is better than bleeding  You understand so called ""man"""
Love you BTS forever  May god bless you forever  🔮💜💜💜💜🔮🔮💜💜💜💜🔮
He's such a cute sensitive baby we millions will always love him!💜💜💜💜
3:25  Tf why anyone isn't talking abt d shirt he is wearing!?!? THAT'S A TAE MEME SHIRT!!!!
I honestly found this really adorable. This really made my day. I love you guys and you have all of my respect💜💜 (I think I’m first aswell :DD)
Once a golden maknae always a golden maknae and he knows he done perfectly cause we love him soo much 🐰🐰🐰🍌🥛🎤🎤🕺🏻🕺🏻💫💫💫
Jungkook is so talented and good son.He is very nice person.Person with a good heart ❤❤🐰🐰💜💜
Just seeing Jungkook's tears I will also start crying. My heart hurts and I can't bear to see Jungkook cry 😭😭
Jungkookieeee 💜✨
ARMY’S he love us so much that’s when he cries when he sees us💜🥲we love BTS
"So basically, Jungkook hits you when... - You call him Oppa -You ask him if he's crying Is he going to slap us if we say that he is handsome? XD"
"BTS: ""Are you crying "" Jk cries more...    Save ur 4:01 mins , cuz this was the whole video abt"
Yes jungkook will always be the golden mankne and he gets lots of love from armies 💜💜💜💜💜🐰🐰🐰🐰🐰😘😘😘😘
"what is the one word that would make jungkook cry? my brain: ""no banana milk""  👁👄👁"
He's our golden kookie and will always be no matter what happens 💙🖤🤍
He is such a cute and sensitive baby but he is just being himself 💜💜💜💜💜
Jungkook:Crys Me:I don't want to live anymore  Poor Kookie😥😭
Jungkook : ( Feels sad ) Me : Army's our little bunny feels sad..!! Army's : Let's feed him💞
"Jk will always be the loveable Golden Maknae of BTS and ARMYs. A very talented , well mannered , sensitive young man.💕💕💕💕💕💕💕🤗🤗🤗"
"Aww jungkookie always cares about his armies and  family, and always wants to give the best performance for us!!!! You are perfect for us, Jungkookie!!!!"
"If he cries,I will also cry with him we armies Love you so much Jungkook.."
when junkook fall in tears he is looking so cute and his watery eyes are looking dam awesome love you junkook....becoz you are soft hearted man like me but i am a soft hearted girl..
"Let's just be proud of how our younger has grown up being much more mature and wise,despite of being maknae,he is pretty sensible and caring!periodt,we just love him with all our heart 👁️👄👁️"
3:31 nobody: Jungkook:yeet his tears
I’m like jk too because whenever one of my family members say “are you crying?” I start to tear up and cry. People say I have a very soft heart. But I am maturing more and more. Jungkook has matured so much! We are all so proud of him.
If BTS cries million's of people cries😭💜 sarangae BTS 💜
I started cryiing when i saw kookie cry cuz i am a person that feels hurt when someone else is hurt but kookie cried cause he thought he didn't do well he is just thinking bout fans not of himself his health so i want him to look after himself as well as fans...:)
"I love BTS members so much, pls God let them live happy life"

Awww thats so cute 😍 its okey with JK cry all you want.
When any ONE of them or all of them cry we cry Y^Y
Tears came to my eyes when I saw Jungkook crying 😢😢😭
Bts hurts and millions of million fill the pain me also 😢😢
Oh my baby JUNGKOOKAA don't cry 😢😭. #BTSYOUARESOPERFECT I LOVE YOU BTSARMY💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 FİGHTİNG.
Only potterheads will know this In tha thumbnail Rm looks a bit like Ron ....when hermione tells him there is dirt on his nose and then when Ron turns to Harry he makes this face....
"Jungkook is so emotional like me...I always get angry with everyone and then when I realize that my attitude was bad, I felt very guilty of myself and get emotional and burst into tears..like Jungkook says, when I talk my tears comes first...my attitude is like him.."
When BTS 💜get  hurt  billions   feel the pain
"he shed into tears just because he couldn't perform well as he thought that really made me cry dear kookie, for us ARMY your performance is always the best"
"If he cries, it's less he has to pee..lol I love the fact these guys are not afraid to cry, just shows they're human and feel things deeply."
"JK cried and Armie's cried too,they don't want BTS sad🤣🤣"
"Absolutely agree that it is best to cry when you are in pain, for whatever reason. However, Jungkook has matured over his years as a man with his international experience would. Plus, I am glad for him that he has channeled his teasing from his older brothers into retuning the teasing to them as much as they deserve. Whether you are the youngest,  oldest, or in the middle, it is more fun to have ""what goes around, to continue going around"". This is one of the reasons there is go much laughter in their family.  Thanks so much for the lovely article.💜😊💜"

I'm just like jungkook whenever asks me if I'm crying I start crying without any reason . I can't celebrate my birthday without shedding tears before the party . It's because I'm really nervous .
On the way to my College and happen to see this video 🤠😪
"Such a beautiful soul, talented young man, and absolute inspiration to many. Any child that needs someone to look up to then this is one!"

If we ask if he is crying he sheds more 😭 tears That sounds so much like me People ask me are u ok? I start tearing up People ask me are u crying Crying fountain begins
He cried bc he wasn't satisfied with his performance. Wow! Just think of how high he sets his goals for that! And those haters always try to dishearten them...
Now this is making  me cry😭😭soo emotional  here
Awww Jungkookah.. 💜💜  It's okay to cry when it's not okay.
"Yeah, that right... If i'm about to cry & nobody notice me, i can control it.. But,  if i'm about to cry & somebody ask me if i'm crying,  i'm unable to hold anymore, tears rolled up 😭"
Thanks for all BT's group caring Jk and love 💖😘💖😘 your the best group 😅🙂😅 sarange borahae
When you put clips o Jk crying I was like scrolling down saying no he is not crying. I am worried if I might start crying tooooooo.
I started to cry when I saw him cry 😭
"Oohhh but I miss that baby kookie, I love that so much.... 😢😢🤧🤧 Noe he is a man.... 😍😍😭😭"
waooow that dance group is so lucky that one of the og dancers/singers/makers of song saw them do a dance cover aaaaaaaaaaaaaaauughhghh so lucky
That's the same for me too😂😂 whenever someone asks me are you crying... I instantly start crying 😂😂
We luv Maknae kOokiE🥺💜💜
"Well seeing jungkook , always inspires me.... I  feel like there lots things that I have to learn while watching you. I love you simle jk.  So smile alottttttt... And God always bless you please stay happy and healthy always. If you cried , watching you break my hearts, but crying is not a weakness it's a strength, beautiful you accept who you are ,why you sad.  But I love your smile..... It's a million dollars simle for me, so always keep smiling 😆  May dear god fulfill all your wishes 😘"
Cute kookie😍😍😍😍
i have been  ✨summoned✨
"Jk at the age of 19: artist Me at the age of 19 later: the year bts disbands, and still in college.   (Don't mind me, I'm just 12. And idk the exact year bts will disband. WHICH IS THE SADDEST DAY/YEAR OF MY LIFE. but bts will always stay in my hearteu 💜💜.)"
나는 우리 모두가 여전히 어린 아이 같다고 생각합니다. 우리는 상처를입을 때 울고 보상을 받으면 웃습니다.
Unknown fact if u want to make me cry there is only one way if u steal/take my food ill cry 100%
Tae is so freakishly fine. It's not even fair that he has a good personality too
*the second edit was the best thing I've ever seen in my life and I'm not even exaggerating*
The second video was breathtaking! V just isn’t of this world. And I’m not just talking about his looks. There’s something very special about him. 💜
"Let's be honest, Taehuyng is superior, he doesn't even seem real"
when you're the most popular dude without even trying that's when you know you're powerful.. that is kim taehyung
"My bias is Jimin, my bias wrecker is Suga, but every time I look at V montages I'm like, mouth open, smile, mouth open, smile. How handsome can you get?!"
"I think the biggest different between V and the other two is that he doesn't show off his body. His appeal, in my opinion, is in his expressions. And goddamn if he looked at me like 3:02 I wouldn't live."
And when i remember Tae is just a perfect angel and soul... it's Impossible not fall in love for him
He is the face of korean entertainment industry his face and charisma is beyond..that is facts!
We Taehyung stans every time we're in the mood to die we just watch his fancams. Lol!
Kim Taehyung was definately on God;s good boy list....He has it all !!
Everybody gangsta till TAEHYUNG exists 💀🔫 Edit: send help people under my comment are fighting 😭😭
"""He should be in the museum""  Yeah, maybe. Even ""his face art"" is in exhibition. Yo ARMY, you know what i mean right😂😂"
Every angle of his face is Another level.. Unique face and thats why he is our Victory of BTS🔥
doctor: you have 5 minutes left to live what do you want to do ? me: watches the second edit
Kim Taehyung the only man in the world that can wear a face mask and oversized sunglasses and still be the most beautiful man in the world. Beyond The Standard of other idols.
"Jimin is my ULTIMATE bias, but I have to say........DAMN, V is one beautiful human being.  His face is unreal."
I need some water after this vedio، taehyung so fucken beautiful.
That’s why he’s call a “KING of FACIAL EXPRESSIONS”.🖤
"Tae is a great great dancer...n his stage presence and expressions are really really appreciated n best in kpop..  -he is known as the ""idol of idols""..meaning a whole lot of rookie idols or idols in general consider him as their role model..n look upto him n wanna be like him...  -The fact that   urbandictionary wrote his real name is beyond beautiful, So it’s officially that Kim Taehyung ( V )  is Worldwide IT Boy , Visual Representative of Kpop , Idol of Idols , Stan Attractor , Face of Kpop , Ethereal Beauty!  -he is well mostly known for his insane visuals and his perfect face with perfect sharp features n has like a ton of titles  under his name for his godly looks and extremely gorgeous visuals"
"Everything and I mean EVERYTHING about this man is absolutely, unbelievably, unrealistically FINE ASF. He didn't get most handsome man in the worlds for 4-5 years straight for no reason....."
His eyes the way he looks at you my God!! He is definitely a piece of art!! He is sooooo fine!!! 🔥🥵🥵 I also liked the 2nd video!
V is a work of art. So true DT!
"""They can make entire fmv of just his eyebrows"". DT gets it."
"With his hair down past his nose, I never thought of Tae as being that handsome.  Then, one day he swept his hair back off his forehead.  I remember being astonished.  WHO was THAT?  His impeccable hairline, the perfect face shape, those EYES!  Yes, he was everything that people claimed he was."
taehyung is on another level tbh! he doesn't need any validations lol
"he's my bias since the first time I got to know BTS. I fell in love the first time I saw it. indeed he is a very valuable creation of God, And Suga my bias wrecker, and I also love all seven of them 💜💜💜"
That's why he's called alien coz he's not someone to exist in this planet. CGV  indeed.
I am an army mom. V is my bias wrecker. Those looks he gives drives me crazy.
DAMN. KIM TAEHYUNG ISN'T REAL
"That's why he is my bias!!! I never change bias no matter he still my favorite in bts. But of course I like all of them. But tae tae is different he got in the look, expression of his face and the way he dance so sexy... 😍😍❤️❤️❤️💋💋💋"
"Well,  that's the big reason why he's the king of visual😊💜💜💜"
"You can make FMVs from his eyebrows alone, but we can make a movie from him staring into the camera so intensely! He has such perfect timing for it <3"
How do you spell perfection? KIM TAEHYUNG That’s how! 😎💜🔥😇
V visual God
"He's out of this world, his beauty and charisma is in a league of it's own...  And to top it all off, his personality is literally perfect as well. Do you remember how Jimin described him as untainted, innocent and pure?! How is he even real..."
"I was sweating throughout all the videos. I think I forgot how to breathe. Second is a winner for me too, Tae is just breathtaking."
V😍
he's the only person in the world that makes me speechless with just a look. so unreal
"Tae's visuals are breathtaking. Match that with his personality, makes him unreal"
I honestly liked all of them. I love the freckle on the tip of his nose. Thanks for acknowledging our king of visuals.
Kim taehyung is idol of idols..
Yes.. He's a something perfect.. He's ART. And he's in MUSEUM OF ARMY :D.  I can't describe how much perfect he is..
Everything about him is beautiful 💜
Definitely the 2nd video!  He just has a way with looking into your soul when he stares at the camera!  It gets me every time!  😍💜
3:01 ngl if i was that girl i would have told v that do you really want me to die 😂😂
Who think that he should do more fmv reaction about each member ???      Me only...ok
Dammmm. Thanks to dt parker I just found the video that I needed my whole life and I didnt know. Second video is lit
let's fall in love with Kim Taehyung in congregation 💜💜
Kim Taehyung is perfect!!!!!!
Yess Taehyung is a masterpiece !! thanks for your reaction
"I agree with you again. There are many, many FMV of Tae. And, let’s face it, it’s hard to find when he doesn’t look good in videos or photos. I’ve read in person, he’s even more stunning which is hard to imagine!"
Although they were all wonderfully made I think number 2 was the best one as well
DT:I feel I'm looking at a piece of art Yes he really is an artpiece .I still can't believe he is existing
"Besides being an excellent show man, his beauty goes beyond imagination. OMG I wish he could see this compilations of his videos. Gorgeous man from heads to toes!! 😍😍😍😍😍"
"""Feels like I am looking at the art"", exactly he is one 😍💜💜"
the funny thing is everytime im  suppose to watch a reaction to vthis is what happen to me....   i ended up watching v and i didnt saw the reaction 😂
I was waiting for this 🤗😍
I like all of them(V)~~~~ n PICK 2 V is too beautiful to be real
"When you React on V , i Love this 😍😍😍"
plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz reactions tae tae vs taehyung 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
OMG 🔥 Tae is perfection 💜
Oh my night is complete omg V is like the guy who’s always tempting me to be a bad girl oh the thoughts of my head now 😍😍😍 please react to Jungkook’s
Yayy KIM TAEHYUNG 😍💜 THANK YOU!❤️
"THe last video, got me repeating the video. Tae... is just..... (no words)"
He is something else 🤩💜V💜
"I would be great full if the make for RM, J hope, Suga n Jin too....."
Hyung line please🥺
A Tae video!  I liked before I even hit play!💜
your channel is the best❤️🇧🇷
You should react to his legendary fancams.
The thing about Taehyung is he DESTROYS any kind of box people wanna put him in.  He is so versatile and can literally be whoever and whatever he wants while killing it.  UNAPOLOGETICALLY
Please react to Hyung line videos next! I have some good links to some Hoseok and Namjoon ones that are HAWT
Did u guys notice he didnt even show any skin? How does he do it???? My entire body is shaking
Glad u enjoyed it as much as we do😉💜💜💜
If you're not biased after watching V  you're bias wrecked 💀
When mah boy starts chewing his invisible gum you better buckle up cause he ain’t come to play.
"When he performs, he is never ever out of character. Every movement, every step, even every pause is intentional and mesmerizing! I've never seen anyone perform like that!"
"Sorry but his visual is top tier in the whole kpop industry. The charisma, the appeal, the beauty, everything"
Can you do it for hyung line too?
Taehyung’s visuals should come with a warning ⚠️
"He is not just a piece of art, he is a full living art"
No wonder why singularity hypnotized everyone on concert..  Army forget that time when they scream
"Kim Taehyung is that one human that can make a person come, without even put a finger on. Like FACT"
The 2nd one is the best and Kim Taehyung is an angel and devil all rolled into one. There is no one better at visuals and expressions than V. He equals perfection.
Tae really is U N B E L I E V A B L E 🔥
"He is like a forbidden Apple.... so tempting but can't be anyone's property... can't even touch... he is just himself that can be only for us to admire, looking from afar... I really imagining someone to make his replica and put it on museum... he is indeed a piece of art"
"I’m telling you mann, you’re right V SHOULD BE IN A MUSEUM PERIOD!!"
Taetae is the most beautiful person in the earth
Tae - *breathes *  Me - *I just can't ....I'm finished*
The thing about V is that he is very photogenic. He has that male model face.
Taehyung is the standard 😍 and I agree the second was on SPOT. It didn't capture all taehyung's charms and how charismatic he really is but at least it was better than the other two.. I liked the music and the arrangement. Taehyung is the king of stage no one is his level from charisma to stage presence and dance moves ALL ARE BREATHTAKING 😍
Love your reactions
Jimin is my bias💜💜💜 but... Kim Taehyung  Damn!!! he's soooo perfect 😍😍😍😭😭😭
"""He is art"" YES MAN."
V is really out of this world. He is supernatural being i believe. His handsomeness is out of control.. I c-cant.....
"It’s not fair that he is handsomely attractive, genuinely seducing, adorably down to earth, pricelessly has wise brain after RM, deeply soothing voice, has perfect masterpiece of hands 🙌 and 🦶 feet., has relaxing but yet perfect dance moves.... OH ....GOD must have taken long time to create this human being....💜💜💜💜you V"
"Most handsome man to ever exist...wow...seems he was hand made by God, way too perfect and beautiful. 2nd edit was a killer."
THIS MAN IS UNREAL I SWEAR TO GOD HE CAN'T BE REAL TAEHYUNG IS A MASTERPIECE🔥🔥🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️ HELP I'M DYING  😭😭😭😭😭😭
Taehyung is a living anime
"This kinda motivates me to study, and thats saying something because im a last minute student, but this playlist is downright ✨magical✨"
Me: **making notes** Also me while listening to the first orchestral cover: *Na nA Na nA na Na nA na Na na-*
the songs are familiar but different... not too distracting. your mixing is really well done. i have never skipped a single song and i got all my homework done. happiest day of quarantine!
"it looks like a collection of Disney songs, but these are definitely much better <3"
This version of Dynamite is everything that could have and should have been. It's amazing!

Let's all agree that BTS is  best at roasting each other 😂!!
There is no need of haters for fighting when BTS come to play something competitive and ofcourse run BTS 😂😂
1:29 Jin did not just do suga like that 😭🖐🏻
*Who is the best roaster in BTS?!*  *1. Jin* *2. Suga* *3. Jhope* *4. RM* *5. Jimin* *6. V* *7. Jungkook*
"3:45   Someone: when jin goes to the gym..  Jk: I'm sorry, what did you say? Jin? At the gym?    We've all seen that clip of Jin on the treadmill when he was supposed to be running 😅😂"
rm: i sing beautiful songs ❤️ jimin: oh no no😫
Angels roasting be heavenly :0
When bts roast eachother  It literally leaves me rolling on the floor like an idiot😂🤣
2:27 thats me walking to my school ofc just beacuse my mom shouted at me
1:40 He did not just expose SUGA!!! Underwear with cute bears!! OMO!!
8:55 I just realized jiminie was on Tae tae's lap
5:40 was amazing 😂😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
2:57 that’s so sweet! jungkook suffers when he sees his friends sad that’s cute! 🥺🥺
2:29 and 2:35 powerful walk by Jiminieee 😂😂😂
This is the second time I'm so grateful to YouTube for recommending me BTS things😭👏😭👏😭👏😭👏😭👏😭👏
0:20 taekook forever ❤️
*Me: trying to write a funny moments*  *_My brain: I dOn'T hAvE tHiNk~~_*
2:06 omg Jimin went in on RM. And omg RM looks so hot here.
Namjoon: yoongi laughs soo much.. these two(pointing at v and suga) V: how can I not laugh when namjoon is so funny Shakes his body in a weird way fAlLs On ThE gRoUnD aNd ShAkEs HiS bOdY WeIrDlY    Me: rolling on the floor and dying😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
OMG my taekook and jimin is so cute and so handsome young man 💜💜
"I love Jimin, “Broken my ear” 🤣"
I think it’s more like vminkook/maknae line bicker with each other but in the end they all gang up on the hyung line and usually win 😂💜😎 2:54 tho I can’t 5:40 Taegi against rm
1:20 👵 entry😂 I'm not making fun of him but as he is teaching RM it's looking like 👵 is teaching 😂😅 Cutie Mochi 😍 How many of you agree with me
7 kings of Killer smile....👑💜 I Just pray that I can watch them just like that whole life..... 😍💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Bts roaster: *exists*   BTS: *I'm about to end this man's whole career*
my question: does yoongi actually wear pants with cute bears on still because IM-
Suga to j hope : you look like a horse  J hops to Suga : you look like a turtle 🐢...omg I can't stop laughing
But Jin's face at the end tho.. He was really hurt :(
0:35 I love that hobi was the only one that responded 💀
You like 7 king's ARMY 💜 BTS forevear 💜 Kim Namjoon Kim seokjin Min yoongi Jung Hoseok Park jimin Kim Taehyung Jeon Jung kook 💜 BTS 💜😂
Suga is so calm every time Love it
"Aww, Jin looked hurt when they said RM is a better dancer than him :("
4:06 RM just yeeted those papers only to make the promise sign UWU...also 5:40 is my fav V moment lol
So cute 😍 💜️💜️💜️💜️❤️
I literally like it when they give the inner thoughts based on their real character at.8.55 ..like how Jimin pulled off the acting which Jin would have done when he sees the girl on the bed and right after tht RM gave himself out by whistling🥳🥳😛
Ultimate betrayal as well😂😂
So Cute 💜💜
So cute ❤❤
Yoongi did not have to tell hobi he looked like a horse but he did anyway 😂😂
"RM:she will be lying in the bed JK:when she screams ,I will light the candles and we will go out . JM:somehow, I feel that jin hyung might like it.... RM:Whistling like ......         Me:fell out of bed laughing like fool😆😆😆"
Not yoongi saying he replied to the group chat msg using telepathy 😂😂
Very funny and cute moment BTS💜 members love you all army💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
1:51....don't you all think jungkook's hair style is so cute❤️
*Normal people after watching this video: They are cute*  *ARMYs after watching this video: **_uwu My Hearteau stob it_*
Jungook and V are so cute
I have a feeling RM sings expensive girl in the show
I feel like if someone roasted Jin’s cooking he’d kill them with no hesitation
Hyung line loves being roast by their lovely cute maknae's. ♡ ~♡

"So hilarious, brightened up my day, thank you 💓💓💓💜💜💜"
"Jimin roasting JHopwe on his wiping, LOL! He was doing it more hygienicly than Jimin😄"
"I swear if anyone puts this video on twitter, army twt will go up in flames espacially solo stans, our fandom is becoming way too sensitive these days over the smallest things and twitter is always a war zone, and tbh that's why I think bts have also toned down their joking with eachother on camera."

What else should we react to? 🤔 Comment below! Also if you like the song in the intro stream ‘I Get Lonely’ here 🖤 https://youtu.be/MGRbKVoBhI0
Knox: Blood sweat and tears man Army: well that's a bts song Knox: that was dope Army: yeah that too Knox: you know like having a 'silver spoon' Army:... Knox:... Army: THAT TOOOOO
"Suga: Sorry mom, your son is so killing it His mom: you look like a boiled dumpling"
"When he said that ""this guy is hiphop"" (referring to RM) 😂 RM is an established rapper before joining BTS. I love how you pay attention to the different style of the rappers. Most vid reactors miss that part. I'm happy that finally someone has appreciated the unique styles of the rap line 💜"
"Bts doesn't stick to one style or genre so  if u want  something fun then ""Boy with love"" and ""Dynamite"" something hip-hop then ""Dope"" and ""Not today"". Something sentimental then ""spring day"" and ""life goes on"""
"""seven... that's a big group.""  my man's not ready for NCT"
"""how many are they? seven! wow that’s a big group!""  nct with 23 members : 👁👄👁 i- ok"
"""There is literally an explosion! That is DOPE, man!"" No this is MicDrop, but heck yeah"
Counting the members of BTS: Wow that’s a big group  NCT: *laughing*
"BTS aren't named the biggest group in the world for nothing , kings as they should"
Agust D Daechwita 😎 this song is from Suga of BTS and its 🔥
Him: “1 2 3 4 5 6 7... MAN that is a big group” Me: “ever heard of NCT?”
BTS rap songs I would recommend: - Moonlight by Agust D - Agust D by Agust D - Daechwita by Agust D - Baepsae (dance practice) by BTS - Spine breaker (MV) by BTS - UGH! by BTS's Rap Line - The Last by Agust D - Ddaeng by BTS rap line - Outro:Tear by BTS's rap line - Dis-ease by BTS
"9:24 BTS was supposed to be a Hiphop group but the company later decided to make them a kpop idol group instead but they still pull a hiphop kind of vibe to many of their songs. Check out the songs No More Dream, N.O, Danger, Boy In Luv, Ddaeng, We Are Bulletproof pt. 2 etc."
"He said Blood sweat and tear, then silver spoon, then Dope. (how come he already knew all BTS's Songs😂)"
"""This boy is hip hop"" Yeah that's Rap Monster"
"""These boys are hip hop!"" YES THEY ARE, BABY! Review all the Cyphers, Persona, Ugh!, Ddaeng, the list goes on. The comments are full of the suggestions."
"Please do more BTS!!!!!!! Something to note if you do react to more BTS, as long as you include the BigHit Entertainment intro to every music video/video you watch, you won't get copyrighted because they see it as advertisement when you react to their videos.And as long as you also watch their videos like how you watch Blackpink (pausing when you speak, paying close attention to the video, etc.,) you should have no issues when reacting to their videos"
"""Persona"" from map of the soul: persona. It is a rap song by BTS Rm."
"More BTS -  “ON” Kinetic Manifesto: Come Prima, Dionysus, Fire, Agust-D Daechwita ..."
"""These guys are hip-hop!"" No More Dream: ""Am I a joke to you?"""
"""Oh this is HipHop! I wasn't expecting this!""  ""... they were originally a HipHop group...😅😂"" please react to their old songs if you're trough with the new more HipHop and Rap stuff they have... esspecialy Cypher 1 + 4, and J-Hopes Hopeworld🌞💜"
"""7, man that's a big group!""  NCT with 23 members: *Am I a joke to you?*"
"""Seven?! That's a big group!!"" Me: *laughs in NCT and Seventeen*"
"Listen to BTS ""ON"" Their manifesto will blow your mind."
“Man that is a big group” lmaoo he should react to Seventeen then🤣🤣
"Check out a lot of the Rap Line songs - ""Dddaeng"", ""Outro: Tear"", ""UGH!"", ""Joker"" (RM), ""Do You"" (RM), ""Daechitwa"" (Agust D/Suga), ""Airplane"" (J-Hope), ""Daydream"" (J-Hope), ""Interlude: Shadow"" (Off of MOTS 7; performed by Yoongi), ""Outro: Ego"" (also off of MOTS 7; performed by J-Hope), ""Intro: Persona"" (off of Map Of the Soul: Persona; performed by RM), The entire Cypher series (parts 1 - 4), ""Change"" (RM & Wale), ""Give It To Me"" (Agust D/Suga), ""The Last"" (Agust D/Suga), The entire Mono mixtape (RM)...  Honestly just listen to all of their songs - not just their rapline songs - because they are hella great artists that are just trying to make a difference in this world with their music. :)"
They are originally a hiphop group and the first members were 2 underground rappers and a street dancer
"Jhope (1.Rapper) rides the rhythm, Suga (2.) goes against the rhythm and RM (3.) makes the rhythm."
Joke and Do you by RM (from BTS)
finally someone who actually reacts and explains rather than just sitting in front of the camera
"The guy who drops the mic, actually drops it in the end of all the live performances."
Knox : ''That was dope'' Army : Talking about Dope...
"They actually started as a hip hop group in 2013 but they actually have the widest amount of genres regarding their songs. Hip hop's just one of them.... They do soulful, rap, ballad, EDM, pop, hip hop, metal you name it... They properly have their own genre by now"
First time seeing a reactor touched so many points on a single MV. Hoping for more BTS contents since they have a lot to offer and I know you'll gonna enjoy it 😉
I can't watch RM coming out of the ambulance without laughing. It just makes me think about how he got stuck in there
Him: Man that is a big group        *NCT cackling like maniacs behind him*
"""Man that is a big group"" 'NCT and SEVENTEEN giggling in the background '"
"FINALLY ! MY ARMYBLINK HEART !!! i been here since you reacted to Blackpink, and this is my first time to comment ! thank you for all your Good and honest comments.  Both group are DOPE !"
"I genuinely enjoyed your reaction! And it's amazing how you noticed so much! I guess it really shows how professional you are 😅 Thanks for the awesome feedback, BTS works so hard to deliver, and the quality is insane and such a huge amount that not many people absorb it fully in the first go!"
RM😭💔❤😝😍🔥💪👌👍👏
"1234567, man that's a big group  NCT has left the chat"
"You’re right.  Suga’s mom didn’t want him to be a rapper, and Ratatouille is like from the Disney movie (or was it Pixar?) if you’ve seen the movie you know that it’s all about how the critics don’t like tasteless ratatouille.  They are looking for the real thing. That was an awesome reaction. I really enjoyed it. It seems like people that know what their talking about always enjoy BTS, whether it’s professional rappers, vocalists, video editors, producers, I even watched an opera singer fanboy over their vocal control. They have a lot of tap and hip hop, but only a few of them have music videos.  Most of the ones with videos are the rap line’s solo stuff like Daechwita, August-D, Joke, Intro persona, outro: ego, interlude: shadow.  Their other rap and hip hop stuff they do together you just have to watch the lyric videos, or live performances (which don’t have subtitles)"
Its funny how every words he says are so accurate for the meaning of the song
"""7... man that is a big group!"" NCT and SEVENTEEN: ...sir"
"""maybe his mom didn't wanted him to be a rapper""   Guys!! He doesn't knows BTS, even a bit but see how he catches the messages conveyed through the music.. Mic drop was one of my first BTS's song but I wasn't able to catch what he did! It took me months to get to know about the backstory of our boys the struggle of our boys.. but this man, he just catched it like snap... The saying is indeed correct ""artist are acknowledged by artists only"""
Him: seven! Man that is a big group Me: laughs in nct
Bts cyphers 1-4 hip hop 100% worthy of listening and reacting
"BTS are an incredibly talented group. They sing, rap, dance, and produce their own music. They have help from the team around them but the rappers in the group (RM, Suga, J-Hope) are heavily involved in the production and writing of their music. BTS has a great music style range, they do hip hop, to more pop songs, to full throttle rap songs, to sweet ballads. BTS are not just “Kpop”, they do everything. It’s great to see a reactor really appreciating the production in the songs."
RM is perfect 💜💜
"""man that is a big group""  me: laughs in nct, seventeen, treasure, straykids, ateez etc."
"""1, 2 3, ...... 7! Man that is a big group!"" Seventeen: ...... NCT: .......   Me: don't get me started"
BTS solo rap songs you should definitely react  to: Agust D - Agust D Agust D - Daechwita RM - Joke
Knox : Ya that's hot! Me ; They are always hot man 😂😂
"How many of them are there? 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Man that is a big group!  NCT: Let us introduce ourselves But fr NCT has over 20 members now"
"if something rap then ,Bts Rm's persona intro."
"""They're 7? Men what a big group.""  Meanwhile NCT: 👁👄👁  Anyways react to ON and The solo mixtapes of the Rappers"
"Rap song for bts ?  Shadow  Cypher 1,2,3,4 Ugh Agust d Daechwita"
Knox: *thinks 7 is a lot* nct with 23 members: ...
"Ok so I have a lot of recommendations lmao. So first the songs with all the BTS members included:  ON kinetic manifesto film + mv - Blood Sweat & Tears - Not Today - IDOL - Fake love - Airplane pt.2 - Dionysus- Black Swan - We are Bulletproof: The Eternal - Bulletproof pt.2 - Blue & Grey - N.O - Epilouge: Young Forever- Save me - Dope - DNA - Life Goes On - Spring day   Rapline songs (J-HOPE, SUGA, RM) Cypher pt. 2-4 - Outro: Tear - UGH! - DDAENG  (You should watch the explanation to DDAENG and UGH!)   Vocal line songs (Jungkook, V, Jimin, Jin)  House of Cards - The Truth Untold - 00:00 (Zero O’Clock)   Solos: V: Stigma - Singularity- Sweet Night - Winter Bear  SUGA aka Agust D: Daewitcha - What do you think - The last - Interlude: Shadow - First Love - SUGA’s Interlude- Burn it - Agust D - Give it to me  Jimin:  Lie - Filter - Serenpidity - promise   Jin:  Epiphany - Abyss   J-hope:  Airplane pt.1 - Chicken Noodle Soup - Boy Meets Evil - Outro: EGO   Jungkook:  Euphoria - Begin    RM:  Moonchild - Joke - Change   Its a lot but I’m sure you’ll like it. There are a lot more songs, this just are my personal favorites. You should also react to live performances:   MMA 2016-2020 - MAMA 2018-2020 - Filter live - UGH! live - DDAENG + Vocal line version - Cypher Medley 2017 - IDOL at the tonight show - Black Swan in the Late Late Show - ON kinetic manifesto film on Jimmy Fallon - Outro: Tear  There are much more lol Anyway, I hope I could help :)"
BTS actually debuted as a hip hop group they have alot of different colors of music
"This is one of the best reactions I have ever seen. I like that you talk about everything overall the production, lyrics, outfit, dance moves, the song meanings, their unique voices and all. Thanks for reacting truthfully to this, you really get the song. FYI😀😀 I couldn't help but subscribe 👍👍"
"""Knox knowing there's 7 members in BTS"" Knox : man that is a big group  NCT  : uhh ahaha:))"
"This is the first time I saw someone talking about Jimin's voice in Mic drop! ! This is such a hip hop driven song, he doesn't get to shine.Thank you so much"
When he said 'maybe mom didn't want him to be rapper' my heart skipped a beat
When he said 'maybe mom didn't want him to be rapper' my heart skipped a beat
"""how many of them are there? 1,2,3...7! Man that is a big group!"" *laughs in nct*"
I would love to see your take on BTS “ON” Kinetic Manifesto Film.
React to Rapmon: Persona.
49 yo Army here. Loved your reaction. It’s great to watch SMART reactors.
"Fun fact BTS used to be a hip hop group, so if you like hip hop you'll love the cyphers and Cypher pt.4 specially."
"Mic Drop is pretty typical for people to check out as it's one of their most Iconic songs. If you're actually interested in their rap talents they have a few choices that are more diverse in their skills.  Cypher series, Ddaeng, Solo songs like the rappers have done. songs that are older like Not today , N.O , No more dream and Dope, Fire. these are also songs I'd recommend. They have dipped their toes in so many genres of music to showcase the diversity in their music and talent that other iconic songs still have really good rap tones but it's delivered so differently.  Spring Day, Idol, Boy with luv, Boy in Luv, Black swan, ON.  Also songs that are from their first two albums have more of a hip hop feel. Hope this helped I like your reaction and the way you broke down the lyrics.  Other groups that have good Rap flows  GOt7 Monsta X NCT (all units)  TXT Straykids just to list a few. Anyhow thanks for the thoughts."
I feel like a proud mom watching my kids talents being recognized  Even thou I am 5 to 6 years younger than the youngest of bts lol
"“man that’s a big group” me as a nctzen *wheezes*, yeah okay"
"DAECHWITA BY BTS SUGA AKA AUGUST D. PROMISE,YOU'LL NEVER REGRET LISTENING TO HIS SONG."
"Suga's ""미안해, 엄마"" is everything. I'm happy to tell I think your bias is in the rap line."
he said blood sweat and tears when talking about his album and that’s a bts song👀
"When you say about SUGA  ""May be his mom didnt want him to be a rapper"" You got it man 😂"
6:02 you got it right.. that's Suga and his parents were unsupportive of him becoming a rapper
Oh lord Rap line outro tear (live version) Rap line DDAENG (live) RM joke August D. August D RM. Do you Rap line : cyphers 1-4 Rapline : UGH the list is endless 😂😂😂😂
"idk if you’ll see this but if you want more good kpop rap suggestions!! try Maze of Memories by Stray Kids, Who Dat B by Jessi, U Mad by Bobby, Mad City by NCT 127, Oh My God by (G)I-DLE, Say My Name by Ateez, Lit by EXO member Lay, and Psyche by Monsta X member Joohoney ☺️"
"If you are gonna be reacting to more BTS, these ones have more rap in them than their recent years:  Baespae (Silver Spoon) War of Hormone DDAENG (though you might need to watch the explained video by DKDTV to get the bars) We are Bulletproof Pt 2 (their second song ever after their debut song 'No More Dream') Fire Die-ease (from their most recent album, BE) UGH! Telepathy (also from their most recent album, BE)  There's also Suga's (the one who rapped the ""billboard"" ""sorry mom your son's killin it"" parts) solo persona, Agust D that is pretty much a polar opposite to his BTS side (from my perspective). 'Agust D', 'Daechwita', 'Give it to Me', and 'Strange' are my suggestions. Though I think you might like the flow in 'Agust D' a lot"
"""Maybe mom didn't want him to be a rapper."" That's exactly what happened to SUGA, who's singing that part😂 But now his mom so fckn PROUD 🥰"
You're a rapper then u definitely need to check out CYPHER PARTS 1 TO 4 Amazing flows with top level lyrics
"OMG! I love how he doesn't hate them just cause he can't understand them. A lot of people don't like them cause they can't understand. That's literally it. Glad he tries to understand the music, the deeper meaning, the dancing, instrumental, etc etc."
"1,2,3,4,5,6,7 wow that's a big group      TAEYONG BE LIKE : HOLD MY KIDS"
"i suggest agust d(he’s known as suga in BTS) “agust d” and “the last” Rap Monster’s “Joke” and “Do You” BTS - “Cypher 1-4”, “Shadow”, “Outro:Tear” J-hope - “Daydream” and “Chicken Noodle Soup”"
"Frickin love your reaction, very perspective and direct to the point. Hope you will react to more of BTS music because BTS has a very wide variety of the genres and this is why I am fanatic with them. Never got bored! 😁"
The way you listen to songs is so cool. I usually just focus on voices and the main beat but you just listen inside the song. You can hear every single thing that's going on there. Like I feel you must be good at multitasking! Also I really like your song.
"BTS is genre-agnostic so you can find songs you'll like with their vast discography. Also their roots are hiphop that's why the rappers stands out. They're three of the best idol rappers in korea. You should check out  the ff MVs Blackswan , ON kinetic manifesto, fire, dope, blood sweat and tears.."
I would absolutely looove to see you dissect all the Cyphers ❤️
"And those bois contributed 4.6 billion to the Korean economy, and even have their mental health campaign that promotes loving yourself that they even presented at the UN. MIC DROP!"
"Come on guys! Lets make him watch all the BTS raps songs🔥  Hey Knox, there are 3 rappers in the group please check out.  Also they started as a Hip Hop group so they will blow your mind"
"I'm really glad that you noticed that! Basically in BTS's music video, everything connects together. Starting from the lyrics, music, choreography, props, cinematography, filters, etc. They are one unit in one package for their songs, you will be even more surprised by the way BTS delivers their messages through their albums. And those are just a few of the many amazing things you can find in BTS!!"
BTS is heavily influenced by hip-hop they even did a reality show in LA in 2015 where they learned the history of hip-hop and were mentored by Warren G and Coolio(lol)  RM and Suga were both involved in the underground hiphop scene in Korea before being signed by Bighit
"RM - Joke, Suga has solo stuff too under the name Agust D. You should check out the rap line’s music. J-hope has a mixtape too, all so good"
"BTS IS A CULTURAL RESET...  CYPHERS, DDAENG, UGH!, """"OUTRO:TEAR"""" IS EXACTLY YOUR TYPE."
"BTS originally was formed to be a hip-hop group however, later decided to make it an idol group, but BTS never forgets their hip-hop roots. BTS music literally comes in different genres, there's trap, pop, ballad and hip-hop or even mixed. As people who listen to them say, BTS is the genre."
as soon as he said silver spoon I screamed bapsae...
The change of his face when RM starts rappiing he be like from this🙂 to this😦

Bts with other girl on way only with blackpink
East or west Bts is the best
WWIII JIN: i raised Jungkook V: no i did jin: i cooked food for him v: i served the food!!!!!!!! !
Jk is lucky to have his 6 hyungs who treat him like he is their little bro
You: Hyungs who raised him Jk parents: So you have admitted we are a joke to you
Jungkook's personality is mixture of his 6 Hyungs They really raised him up to a wonderful person 🥺💜
"""Seeing hyungs having hard time, is the only hardship."" That line was really touching"
BTS is a whole family .  RM : Father Jin : Mother  Suga : Grandfather  J-hope : Uncle  Jimin : Sensitive child  V : Handsome child  JungKook : Talented child   So in total there are 3 children in this family .  💜💜💜💜 I love you BTS
Everyone is first until they refresh their page
Jungkook was so young when he has debuted  but now he is mature and responsible he is our cute talented makne our love for him can't be measured....his vocals and dancing skills are really amazing he is cute and handsome...we have written his name in our hearts and no one can erase...He has learnt so much from his hyungs jungkook is so lucky to have 6 precious hyungs and they are lucky to have makne like kookie....
JUNGKOOK IS SOOOOOO CUTE AND HANDSOME
*Your is mine. Mine is mine. Everything is mine.*        JK~~ I really love him when he say that they taught me not to be selfish. They are his real and best hyungs.🥺💜
Our cute bunny is good at everything because other members are with him who always there for guide him 💜
IMAGINE JUNGKOOK HAVING A GF   JUNGKOOK: YOU'RE MINE ALONE.
BTS is a family not a group. . .💓💓💓💕💕💕💜💜💜they treat each other as brothers nothing more. . .experiencing struggles and hardships together. . .their stong bond makes them what they are today. . .way to go boys. . .we love you. . .😘😘😘no matter what happens in the future armys were always here for all of you. . .💕💕💕💜💜💜god bless you always. . .😘😘😘wishing more blessings to all of you. . .💕💕💕💜💜💜BTS OT7. . .💕💕💕💜💜💜
he is a manifestation of all of their characters
I really love how jin supposed to raise and treat jungkook like his own brother that was so heart touching!
"It's good to know that JungKook learned from his Hyungs  and he tried everything they taught him and that's what he is now ,a better person and was loved by his Hyungs and the Army...💜💜💜"
"Jungkook said that it hurts him when he sees his hyungs cry or in difficult times  And we armies get hurt or cry when we see them crying,sad or hurt 😭💜💜 His role model is his hyungs and our role model is all of them they taught us so many things they are really the best..☺️ 7-1=6 for other peoples But for us....😢 7-1=0 armies will be with them till eternity .. BTS we love you💜💜"
"Thank you again to you BTS7 ARMY8 but you made me cry once again. Yes, Jungkookie is a grown man now and he got the best brothers who inspired and taught him good values, good behavior towards himself and to other brothers. He is such a simple caring boy who grew up to be a very fine young man and ARTIST. I'd say he got .good teachers and role models. BTS is family, loving, caring and supporting each other's back once needed. I love ALL BTS KINGS FOREVER."
💜They are not same blood to become brothers but they are a family in which there is a bond between them a bond that will never break 💜
"I wish i can be like jungkook , leave school at 15"
Jungkook loves his members like his parents
"""Jungkook"" - Mentored by the ""Superstars"", ""Now the World's Biggest ""Superstar"". Aussie friend!!!"
6 elder bros made their little bro the best maknae ever🤗
BTS are the best teachers in this World..💜Jungkook is really very lucky to have 6 hyungs who love and care for him so much
You can really see how he has become a loving and compassionate young man 💜
Jungkook is a amazing person. He is so lovable and caring
Others: junkook        My eyes : searching for our sugar boy yoongi👀
I am also selfish but bts specially jungkook changed me
Well I’m so proud of him so much and BTS for helping him💜💜👏👏🥲 i’ve been knowing BTS since 2013
I love how the members let Jungkook rule over them and endure his every sweet torture😂...as if he is their own younger sibling😂
"this made me cry,honestly.Just like yoongi once said it truly is an amazing miracle how the yoonieverse prepared such an amazing team,people who were meant to be with each other,who got along so well.Like the pieces from a puzzle. *'what a relief we are seven'*  *'what a relief we have each other'*"
They are the best siblings ever. To have big brothers/ sisters to lead you on the right path is so good💜💜💜💜💜💜💜Highly Appreciated we can learn a lot from each of the members. Borhae!
"He is the living manifestation of his members. You can see he developed their personality bit by bit. Combined by his own personality, he becomes the golden maknae we all know"
Adorable kook kee...🤗🤗🤗
It's not just Jungkook but also all the 7 members changed us for the better. It makes me cry knowing how BTS helps each other
"No views, 9 like, 2 comment... YouTube logic.🤣🤣🤣😂"
"I went to the concert and what I heard about v,s grandma I got so sad and I could not even notice Jungkook crying"
They have raised him..We can all see the different qualities in Jungkook of all his lovely hyungs..😊💜
Please appreciate their meaningful decision .BANGTANFOREVER!
Kookie......💜💜💜💜💜💜
Even when he is old he is still our baby maknae
Loved you Jungkook 💖💖
Jungkook is so lucky having his hyungs who taking care of him very much😥😭💜💜💜 I wish i have brothers like them😭😥💜💜💜
I love jungkook 🥺💜💜💜
They grow and mature all together helping and guiding each other.
Our golden maknae *JUNGKOOK*
Jungkook is 1 very lucky young man to have 6 of the best brothers to help teach him things that are important to have in your life. 💜💜💜💜💜💜
"I almost cry sometimes when I see how much he loves his Jin. And I laugh at how Jin just takes it in stride when Jungkook hangs on to him. I think Jin was a replacement for his mother, whom he was too young to leave. The best big bro ever."
Jk Bunny is the 90% complete product of his 6 Hyungs. fighting! #BlessAllYour💜7BTS😉사랑해@74🇵🇭
Thank you💜💜💜💜💜Jungkook is so angel💜💜💜💜💜
all of his hyungs helped him in different ways <3
Best maknae ever💜
"JK is so adorable, he was raised by six brothers and has a little of all of them in his character. This video is so heartwarming and precious. He has such a soft spot for his brothers that he can easily be moved to tears when it comes to them. That is true love and devotion. After all he has spent more years with the members than with his family. JK, your older brothers have taken good care of you and are there with you through the good times and the not so good, that is why you love them all.💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
"I didn't know that the baby Kookoo is me now, but I can change too, right?"
Jungkook at 13 years old Left the Busan to become K-pop idol... And Me At 13 years old cheering them😑💜 Ughhhgghhgh.... Whatever I am happy about that I'm cheering them 😅💜💜💜.... BTS literally taught me how to live like an Angel 😄....I love them more then my own life... Love you ~<BTS_X_Army's>~
And I am still learning soooo many things from BTS and Jungkook too ..... They are perfect in every possible way 💜😘
If you have friends like that... lucky 💜💜💜
Jungkook is so lucky enough to have them
Jungkook younger he bts member jungkook compassion all people also say love army..💜💜💜 All sacrifice jungkook to start 13 year old..
"oh my god, i wish i had somebody like bts in my life cause I’m pretty much everything jk was and it’s so hard cause you can’t truly be yourself, but I have no one to help me break out of being sealed inside myself, what a family they are💔"
I love BTS 💜💜 BTS every members are very cute and kind and protect each other. That friendship is pure. Jungkook is very lucky. That because of he learned and change his personality and a lovable person 💜💜💜💜💜
JK😙💖💖💖💖💜💜💜
They are THE BEST HYUNG'S EVER 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜👍
"BTS has made me open up about things that pained me for a really long time ,  its so revealing to now I have such amazing role models as my idols 💜💜💜"
I am mad for Him 😍💜💜😘 I can't explain how much love him 😞 he is really golden maknae😍me and everyone everywhere💕
Introvert - just Like me jk we are the same but your so lucky because you have hyungs while me 😢
JK is so lucky that he got such a loving and caring brothers 💜💜😘🥰🥰 EAST OR WEST 💜 BTS IS THE BEST 💜
His best line I no her face but not her name will go in history
"Oooohhhh .. So, that's the reasons why he is so perfect?!😯"
"When kookie wanted to leave Jin stopped him,when hobi wanted to leave kookie cried for him.I mean to say they are more than family.their is no words to describe their love for each other 💜🤗💜"
I think I have to learn from them too.. from all the members...  I hope I can do it because they are my inspiration... I love them very much 💜💜💜
My fav groups is a good dad and now look how succesfull they are becouse of thier good personality and thier love for thise surrounding them

"오빠, 솔직히 말해서 ... 부모님뿐 아니라 나 자신에 대한 자신감을 키우도록 영감을 주셨을뿐만 아니라 당신도 마찬가지입니다. 솔직히 형들뿐만 아니라 당신도 저에게 동기를 부여합니다. 왜? 당신의 장애물, 문제, 그리고 당신이 겪은 모든 것까지. 넌 터프하고 나도 이기적 이었을지도 몰라 내 4 남매 중 맏이라서 그래도 만났을 때 ... 너는 내 감정까지 모든 것을 바꿨어. 당신은 당신의 재능, 힘, 정직함뿐만 아니라 모든 사람에 대한 당신의 사랑으로 나를 때렸습니다. 하나님이 우리에게 A.R.M.I.E.S 당신에게 7 개의 호빵맨을 주 셨는데, 그 무엇보다도 우리 자신을 다른 사람으로 만들고 자신을 사랑하는 것은 신과 우리 가족에 대한 우리의 믿음을 강화하는 것입니다. 우리가 계획하지 않은 최고의 일이고 절대 놓아주지 않을 것을 약속합니다."
"When I was about to cry, then the iconic line of Jungkook came out........ and I immediately laughedXD thanks to the funny line, I didn't cry......."
I purple you jungkookie sooooooooooo much💜💜💜🤟🤟🤟🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😘😘😘
Our jungkook is so lucky to have 6 amazing hyungs who took care of him during his crucial times and helping him as he joined in a very young age but he was happy becuz he had his hyungs who took care of him like his parents
Bts brotherhood is so amazing and inspiring
"The members weren't ALWAYS good to JK: remember when they prank'd JK on his birthday in 2013 and it went on for the longest time!  In all fairness, 10 minutes or more was from the manager but RM kept it going and all the other members were in on it.  & JK was very young."
"Most of them heard this that parents raised their children.  Only armys knows that brothers can raise their younger brother /baby of the group. Bts is the role model for all armys. I swear you can't see anyone like bts. Bts=perfect. I don't know how many of their facts inspired me. Being an army is the best thing for me. At first I hate myself, no confidence ,but bts changed me. ( sorry for my bad English, I'm not good enough at English)"
JJK!!!!!!!!!!!💜💜💜💜💜💜
BTS Rocks as they are legends.
He's talented He's cute hot and sexy  He's everything Our golden maknae Jungkook
As I watch this video I keep telling myself not to cry but I can't.  Don't touch me I'm soft.  😢😭
Jungkook was raised by his parents I don't know where this hyungs raising him narrative came from
He was shy in past .....And now you know army😁😂
He is multi talented... He does many things perfectly... 😊❤❤😘
"He was never selfish for us,He is not selfish for us,he will never selfish for us!"
Otsukare: National Anthem of Sope Nation
Yoongi is always full of energy whenever he's with Hoseok.
Bighit: you need to sing Suga: No Bighit: with Jho— Suga: aight where’s the lyrics
Now....how are y’all better at pronouncing “Otsukare” than “Hyung” 😂😂😂
sope looks like the 2 drunk uncles you see at a bar singing karaoke
"familia there is also an ot7 live performance of ""otsukare"" u should definitely check that out. This song is instant serotonin boost"
"you've worked hard today familia <3      but even if you didn't, treat yo self!!"
you guys need to watch all members sing and dancing to this💜
this is the most iconic song to exist!!
there's .... 1. jk blonde selca 2. jin weverse 3. BE essential version coming (**cries in broke*) 4. BTS original contents( probably a hint for festa 2021) plus Marisol and Uthman with their chaotic reaction oh god let me breath T___T
O dear I clicked it as fast as I can 😂
"SOPE is so multi-talented. They can dance,sing and rap. I mean BTS in itself are so multi-talent so it shouldn't be a surprise. And thank you mexinese family for amazing reactions. p.s.- I hope you are liking the 'comedy theater' you have applied for."
*J-hope convinced Suga to wear this suit blue with a flower😂💜*
J-Hope is the hidden gem of BTS.  He can do it all...
there is an ot7 version of otsukare that i sent on patreon. i was so hopeful you would react to that as well 😭
THIS PERFORMANCE OF SOPE IS ICONIC
We seriously need more hobi and suga sub units😂♥️
*Yoongi would never do this with some other member---->>>I just know*
Damn...I was waiting for this reaction...God bless.. Can you react to the ot7 performance of this song?
React to Jhope and Suga friendship(sope moments I think about a lot of). they are so different but together they are so funny. they call themselves sope. they are like + and - that's why they reach out to each other.
ALSO DID YOU SEE JK'S BLONDE HAIR SELCA IN TWITTER? SOME ARMY'S WENT CRAZY AND SOLD OUT A BED WHICH WAS WITH JUNGKOOK AT THE SELCA
IM EARLYYYYYY😭😭😭 I mean I have class rn- but this is important-
"Thank goodness, finally your reaction to SOPE's debut song, Otsukare..."
Sometimes I accidentally hum this song myself without realizing it.)) Who else remembers how Suga said that he might still try his hand at rock or trot genre? And then the editor inserted about a minute of this performance. I can't wait to see how the MIN genius will show his talent in these genres.
"Plz react to"" Jhope is actually your bias"" plz he's birthday is coming up 💖  I love you familia"
I was just about to go to sleep but I’m so happy I didn’t 😊 also i just know Yoongi was the one who begged Hobi to make not only the song but the performance 😂 he may not seem like it but we know he secretly likes this kinda stuff 😆
there's also a live version of all members  performing the Otsukare song. I hope you'll also watch it
"I’m so happy to hear you guys saying Japanese phrases! お疲れ様です, we say “otsukaresama desu” this is a polite way. We use this phrase all day at work! Purple you from Japan 💜"
The fact that Yoongi would never agree to do this with anyone else lmao
No... It's not a random reaction. You guys just come today like you guys know I had a bad day. Thank you familia❤️😉
I seriously need more of vocalist jhope😭
"Yeah! It's all Japanese song with Korean Trot music style. Otsukare is a casual way to say to your friends and colleagues. If you want to say it to elder people or bosses in a polite way, you should say ""Otsukare - samadeshita."" Japanese ARMYs love this💜💜💜"
"Rocky must be going through his teen phase. Trot music is repetitive but it's meant to be fun and joyous. The lyrics aren't usually deep and it's meant to have a nostalgic vibe. Yoongi is a true producer and lover of music. I can see him coming up with a super successful jingle like Baby Shark and being rich forever because he isn't snobbish about the music he makes. He said he wants to make all kinds of music. Yoongi is also an active and silly person, he's not always tired or standoffish but Hobi definitely brings it out of him more."
"This is a legend.It is often said among Japanese that Jhope is the good at pronouncing Japanese.On the other hand, Yoongi said that Japanese is difficult for him.It was shocking when he sang a song like Enka(the old Japanese way of singing), which is difficult for even Japanese to sing. It's thanks to our sunshine💐☀︎"
"Haha yes, I’ve watched this so many times. They always sing this when they’re in Japan and there is also a BTS group performance version of this as well."
Me and my sister dance to this I'm Yoongi she's Hobi😂💜
"Awwwww, aren't these duo the cutest🥺 I love it when Yoongi's with his soulmate, JHOPE."
"I don’t know about any behind the scenes reaction from the rest of the boys, but they do have a performance where the whole team joined in the fun. I love that version too 😆"
Your life is a lie if you did not know about Otsukare... it's the national anthem of our sope nation... I have no idea how you have never heard of it. But it's better late than never. I love that you both enjoyed it. 💜💜
oh my I can't believe you still haven't watched it 😂
The ot7 otskare is really fun to watch! Tjeir expressions are gold😂😂😂
hobi is the only one that can make yoongi do this 😭
I literally wanna know how much bighit payed yoongi to do this onstage....wearing the glitter jacket and acting cute lmao🤣
"Familia can you react to ""jungkook imitating everything"""
SUGA + J-HOPE = SOPE 💜
"Please reaction to ""Jimin- Serendipity""💞💞"
This is our [ Sope shippers ] national anthem..Where are my sope worldians at!?
ohhh wow I can't believe you reacted to this just now😂!  you need more of sope world
I love how these boys can make each other do things which they would probably never do themselves..😂
"I freaking love this song...along with Arirang! BTS also sang this together ""Otsukare"" funnnnn!"
Lmaoo Yoongi in sope hits different
"Idk if you guys know this, but when hobi and yoongi keep opening and closing a door for their sope lives and shows and stuff, its because they call themselves (sope) the hwagae market and they are opening and closing the market hwagae market is a real market in Korea in between the provinces where they are from yoongi is from Daegu, in gyeongsang province, and Hobi is from gwangju, in jeolla province it is said that the hwagae market is the place where people from their provinces would meet, and despite their differences, come together that's why sope call themselves the hwagae market"
"""ANNDDD no one actually reads this far down..."" i read all of it before i watch the video hahaa , im so glad you guys finally make reaction to this song cause its one of my favourite song .Thank you and i love u guys so so so much familia !! 💜💜💜"
Okay Familia posted... My homework can wait.
Yoongi is superconductor with the radiation of the sun(hoseok) ☀️
They are the most adorable duo haha
Yoongi is so adorable
Iconic Sope moment. This song will be stuck in your head.
Also idk if you know but there’s an OT7 version of this song and it’s super fun watching the performance 😆 love you familia and thank you for the video 💜
TELL ME THE TRUTH  WHO WANTS  OTSUKARE PT2 OF OT7??
omg who remambers the live after this perphormance when they made a  prank and yoongi said that they decided to break up and hobi started to  cry .lol
Jhope and Suga😆 I love SOPE so much  I love this song🥰so happy🐿💜🐱💜
This song makes me so happy and cheerful !!!  ICONIC REALLY <3
"Now Rocky has his own glasses too, along with the chair. So adorable ☺️"
Hobi and yoongi sang otsukare like trot. So that’s why they kind of have that rasp bc that’s what trot is. It like a rasp/vibrato. Even though it was in Japanese my Korean grandma enjoyed it because it was trot😂
Even there is a ot7 performance of this song❤
J-Hope gives suga energy and sope gives me energy😂
SOPE anthem! Please watch more SOPE they are so hilarious together. It’s a different side of Yoongi.
"OMG.... I heard this song somewhere on social media. At that time I did not know who the Creator was. Then I saw Hobi and Yoongi live performance, at that time also I did not think they are the actual creator of the song. (Actually, I got to know the BTS in 2020. I'm new to the ARMY and also to the Familia). Today, just now, because of you I get to know that the song was actually created by BTS SOPE. How wonderful."
"My favorite intro..  ""WELCOME HOME FAMILIA""  💜"
This is ICONIC. I saw this when I was just a baby army and it is one of the reasons suga became my wrecker!! He is so cute and funny in this. And j-hopes energy always makes me smile!
that’s a SoPe National anthem💜.
I love you guys more than this world😍😍😍😍💜💜💜 You guys introduced me to bts Thank you Purple you guys and Rocky 💜
I love sope! I played this song every day for like a month when I first heard it. It’s a classic!
It will forever remain iconic—
Only with j-hope would yoongi do this 😆. SOPE multitalented performers 🕺🕺
They also performed this together with all the members 💜
SOPE FOREVER!!!! Nothing puts a smile on my face like the SOPE anthem. 💜💜
"It is impossible to not smile like a complete idiot during Otsukare; J-Hope's energy and that special silliness only he can bring out in Yoongi is scientifically proven to be irresistable.  (Fun fact: They introduced themselves as SOPE-me as a little riff on Homme, a former BigHit duo with Lee Hyun and Lee Changmin, formerly of 2AM, who left the company in January 2018)"
"First time this fast, we purple u 💜"
Not even exaggerating when I say I listen to this almost everyday
"For me otsukare means dancing crazily with happiness ❤️❤️ No matter how sad I am, this song always makes me jump out of the bed 😁😁😁"
OT7 Otsukare performance letsgoo
SOPE's National Anthem!💜🌟
Wow!! I have the biggest smile because I was comment of the day ( thank you!! ) and because Otsukare is the funniest and wholesome song ever!! SOPE are so freakin CUTEEEEE!!! 🖤💚have a nice week Familia 💜
They opened the Hwagae Market at the start (where they mimicked opening a double doors at the start). They also close it whenever sope is done or leaves!  Its so cute. Sope is an iconic duo.
Otsukare performance is ✨untouchable✨
You guys have to watch when they all performed it together it’s so good
"Thank You:) Finally my mood improved. BTS Forever. I Love SOPE Otsukare:) Today... I needed it very much. Thanks JHope:) Thanks SUGA:) Energy, Sweet and Fun:) Super positive Song:)   Be Safe Everyone"
J hopeeeee i love you
SOPE SOPE SOPE MY FAVE DUO 🥺
"Performance I love this ver much, Sope-me amazing 😄❤"
I'm Japanese. The lyrics of this song are all in Japanese!! I love it.
Please can you react to otsukare but when you sing it all💜 We purple you 💜
You guys should watch the ot7 version where all the members did this live😂
"yay, i woke up to a Mexinese Family video uhuul!!! Guys, there's a ot7 Performance but I could find it only on twitter and one with spanish subs if you guys want... It's so good, my boost of serotonin always 😂😂"
Thank you for this reaction! I'm a japanese baby army and I didn't know this song untill the movie. I really appreciate SOPE's singing in Japanese together😭
"The irony of the 2 members that are totally opposites yet seem perfect together. I guess that's where the phrase ""opposites attract "" comes in. ❤"
"I'm so happy you finally reacted to it, there's also an ot7 performance of it. it's such a happy song"
"I remember hearing and seeing this for the first time and i thought it's an old japanese song that they're doing a cover for japanese armys hahahahahahh. Really didnt know back then that it was an original song composition by hobi. It sounds sooo good and like a legit japanese song. If you watch some old anime ost's, you'll get what i mean 😂"
Omggg Yoongi is a dangerous man xaadyyejptttuiydxh
Popular opinion: Every ARMY is happy because Min Yoongi is back..
"“If you want to love others, you should love yourself first.” -RM"

"PANDEMIC ARMYS wants everything to go back to normal. So we could meet them in person. Fan meets are so impossible. EDITED 1: yeah, i became an army during the pandemic period and i was like, where was I before the pandemic!? Why didn't i know them beforeeeee huhu  EDITED 2: I heard about them before around 2016 and to be honest, I didn't really like them when I first saw them on a photo, don't hate me please, that was before, Maybe because of their colorful/weird fashion statement at that time (those hairdye and makeup, that wasn't my taste for men, I think it was weird) but when I really got to know them during the pandemic, I'm amazed with their skills and story. That's why I'm so eager just to meet them in person like in a LIVE CONCERT or even in a FAN MEET but, it's seems so impossible.   NORMAL is such a precious word for us pandemic armys or even to all of us armys that never ever had to meet BTS in person.. (sad)"
"OMG jungkook's hair he's so so so hot, handsome and cute at the same time"
J hooooooooooope❤️❤️❤️

Bighit staff must be struggled to find taehyung ugly pictured
"Jin's way to solve everything, even the world war: Rock,paper,sissors😂😂😂🤣🤣"
"V : calm, cool and easily succeeding Frustration : am I a joke to you?"
taehyung will literally kill army he looks so cute in curls
No one is talking about how Taehyung slowed for Yoongi🥺🥺💜
"Taehyung is so calm. He never panics and even if he loses sometimes, he just let it pass and take another opportunity. He doesn't rattle or complain and even help the staff. I aspire to be in his level. One of the traits I love about Taetae."
"TAEHYUNGS HAIR I CANT 🥵 AND THE HEADBAND, HES SO FINEEEE"
Me: trying to focus on all the members Taehyung: nice try
The ever handsome Taehyung so calm no pressure he just enjoy the games.
Suga is stressed. Suga keeps makinh noises because of anxiety. Suga is a little meow meow.  Suga at the brink of losing his mind over games. Suga is me 😂😂😂
"“don’t whine before you try, Jimin” - Jimin to himself."
10:54 v is so kind and an adorable human being
"Taehyung's character, patience, calmness, perseverance, cuteness and softness is so evident in this episode. One of my favorite episodes since I learned a lot from the 7 of them 💜"
Istg Taehyung is the definition of CHILL
TAEHYUNG AND SUGA LOOOKK SOO HANDSOME HERE I MEAN THEY HIT DIFFRENT
"Taehyung : ""I'll erase it ,you must be tired"""
Why is V throwing the cards so charismatically 😮😮
Taes voice so soft and delicate omg
"JHOPE SHINING IN SWEAT  NAMJOON SAYING ""I'M A MAN TOO"" SUGA WHINING LIKE A BABY  JIN LOOKING SO HANDSOME IN SHORTS  V BEING THE KINDEST CREATURE JIMIN JUMPING AROUND JUNGKOOK BEING SO FINE AT EVERY GAME IS THE BEST THING TO SEE TODAY 😍😍😍"
"Taehyung seems to enjoy playing games. Rather than wanting to win, it seems like you're completing the puzzle slowly and perfectly. so cute and angelic.😍💜"
No one: Not even a single soul: Yoongi: whining like a baby after every loss🤧
"I just want to hug Taehyung every time I look at him. And he gave up the cups for Yongii. He's such a nice person, bruh. And the more I look at Jungkook the more he lowkey reminds me of my favourite Japanese actor. Not really in personallity but more in looks in my opinion. I can not explain why. They just look so simmilar to me."
"Jungkook and Jimin is leading the game, how competitive...and taehyung is so calm, namjin acting like a couple, hope complaining is so cute, and suga.....this isn't the sleepy suga we knew..they're all cuteeeeeeeeee❤❤😂 and funny"
13:23 DID HE JUST SUCCEEDED ONLY AFTER 3 TRIES— yes. U are the golden maknae Jungkook yes.
1. Jeon fluffing Jungkook: how? Why? 2. Park Jiminah: Hula hooping like a god 3. Kim Seokjin: You're the funniest of all 4. Kim Namjoon: we kn your the man!! 5. Jung Hoseok: How is it possible??? 7. Min Yoongi: Poor thing but so pretty 8. Kim Taehyung: More beautiful inside
Can we talk about how good Suga looks with a headband🤩
Jungkook really hates loosing. He’s so competitive and good at everything
"Taehyung is so kind , humble and a very sweet boy in nature 🥺. I love him so much. Whoever would be taetaes partner I hope she gives him all the love and make this boy always happy😘🤩"
V is really good guy.he is sooo silent and sooo cute I really like his personally 💜️
taehyung is so talented man that's is reason why my idol man is taehyung 😁💜 love you BTS so much 😚
I felt so happy when suga win coz he was the least lucky guy in this ep. They r so cute while playing. I think v let suga win in cups game. He purposely pulled out two cups at a time. 🙄❤️
*Is the universe like rigged in Jungkook’s favour? He’s literally great at everything like??????*
No one: literally no one: Jimin to himself:ahh jimin aahh 😂😂😂
"Really No One is talking about our Kookie JK, he's the all-rounder 😄"
Why is Seokjin always funny without even trying to be funny
26:24 The way Suga patiently waiting for V and JHope to finish playing... and the way he politely asked JHope to play with him.. he is so adorable.. ahhh my hearteu 💜
"Jimin and jungkook ste so competitive, also always the best in everything. They did really good and they were fast"
Can we talk about how sweet taehyungie when he can possibly win the cups game with suga but decided to lose that game instead because yoongi keeps losing? That's make my heart flutter and awe. 😢💜💫 29:29 check this and put the playback speed to 0.05 you'll appreciate the slow motion. 😊
26:28 suga is so cute. He's the cutest in this episode
Tae’s struggle with roulette is so cute😂
Doctor: u can’t die just because someone said “7” Jungkook and my heart: Are u sure about that?
No one Taehyung's hair be like 🍜
"In this show different emotions were shown and make you realize about life..the funny frustrated but determined Jin Hope and Suga, the calm and determined V, the observant  Namjoon, the talented Jimin and Jk that made some of the  game look almost easy"
Taehyungs visuals are no joke... even plastic surgeons can't find any fault... anyways they are all good looking so I'm gonna shut up
"*Taehyung is so calm. He never panics and even if he loses sometimes, he just let it pass and take another opportunity. He doesn't rattle or complain and even help the staff. I aspire to be in his level. One of the traits I love about Taetae.*"
TAE is looking so cute in PINK clothes
"The calmest award goes to ??? 😁😁😁. V calmness always amazes me, he never complained and shows no sign of aggression, very good personality to be a role model I must say, he never stops and just keep on trying. He's so precious 💗, I hope he finds his happiness soon, or maybe he did already because this time around he looks happy unlike on this recent run bts episodes which where he was in burnout phase. I have hope/supported him with someone I wish he with, but now! I don't care with whom anymore, as long his happy, being love and appreciated that would be enough for me as a fan. He deserves happiness! Goo aim high our dearest Tae-Bear because You're destined to break records. 💜💜💜💜 🙆🙆🙆! No one can put you down! No one! We are here to support you! 💕💕💕🙆"
"I just love tae being so calm while everyone is in chaos,he never rush to everything💜"
Jhope gets cuter everyday. V with a headband literally gets me drooling all the time
V is the  most cutest member . These days he doesn't talk . It was good when he smiles. His smiling face  makes me happy.
No one only yoongi whining like a baby after every lose
JIMIN IS SO GOOD AND VERY DETERMINE IN EVERYTHING . I LOVE HIM SO MUCH...
Taehyung is really funny
“NAMJOON IM THE MAN TOO!”  Everyone: YES
Jimin gots it . . His determination wins at all .. labyah ...
Noone: Literally every one was frustrated while doing task  mean while V just did it like   28:04
Taehyung with his composure and calm personality 😌
"Taehyung oppa is so humble , cute ,calm, respectful and I have no words . Hope oppa you will always be like this ...,💜💜"
35:36 when you realize that even Jin’s legs are thinner and sexier than yours
29:39 notice our taehyung 😍. He have a chance to win but he let  suga to finish first.😊☺. That's why I love him.
No one talks on how jimin is so good at these like BE PROUD YALL
Jimin and jungkook outshined *red heart *tae was calm as ever did well too *purple heart *jin and suga being the maknaes ( cry babies )        * feeder * hoseok ummmmm can't  say wasn't  anyless than a baby either *sunshine* and here comes our leader ...being a man toooo *eyes* Ah love them more than anything
Taehyung and Suga look so fine. I mean Taehyungie's perfect curls amd Yoongle's hair in a headband....wowww💜💜
there's only one thing Jungkook can't do                     fail.
aww taehyung is so cute
The thumbnail looks like Tae was about to do something evil and Yoongi was running for his life 😆😆😆
I was literally feeling bad for yoongi when he was loosing in the candies game continuously...but it was funny💜
Taetae was so adorable.  His curly hair.  Him being the only one who was not frustrated from outside 🐻
Jin hyung and Suga hyung he’s so cute🥰
jimin hula hooping will never leave my mind now
Tae was trying so hard to mark the square he kept missing it I was starting to get mad lol.
Ahh I am soft jiminaaah he so good at every thing... He motivated him self that's so peaceful!!🤧💜✨
"How the heck does taehyung look amazing even in his ugly pics , I look ugly even in my best ones😂"
Tae looks like Ha-na from The Uncanny counter istg ejhsgwhsugwhshsfwysy
rest of bts: go pose for pictures hobi: poses for picture tae: *i just wanted to upload a photo of a landscape*
This video be proving to the haters that junkook is in fact is a *golden maknae*
Literally no-one is talking about jiminah how well does he do 🥺💜
36:37 good bum namjoon lol
"Nobody: Namjoon to himself: ""Namjoon, I'm the man too"""
Literally no one :  Jin : a boucy party is going on behind him. I cant 😂😂😂
Yoongi: HOBA Me: *dies out of cuteness*
I really liked jimin characteristics of not giving up and jungkook so easily passing all game as if they are really appreciate easy
This single episode is proof of why bts so hugely successful. Not a one of them quit easily. I mean I was trufrated watching 😂
"J-hope's reaction is so cute after finishing that challenge, what a hard earned success"
Seeing yoongi frustrated and whiny I got tursfrated!😂😂
Every one is a gangster until Min Yoongi come with a headband  .. Headband is min yoongi thing ...❤️🌚
Let me talk about our Seokjinnie cause he's so cute..poor him working hard to win the tennis ball game💜😂 and him regretting wearing the short😂..and also Hobi he's so adorableee. He was about to cry🥺💜
Poor suga he looks so cute when he fusses over loss and jk wow
"""if Jin can't go home,  RM can't go home too"" my NamJin heart : 😌👏"
"2:00 So, No one is literally gonna talk about how Tae is STARING RIGHT AT YOUR LWKCLSMDM SOUL?!? Excuse me sIr?"
I love how all the guys have their own style of playing. Some get frustrated easily and some don't ! It is all funny and nice to watch. If everyone was the same it would be boring as hell so I'm glad they are all unique and comedic in their own way.
"sir— THAT KIM TAEHYUNG OVER THERE, IS LOOKING SO FINE AND MANLY WITH THAT CURLES"
no one literally no one: TAE: *STAY AWAY FROM MY GALLERY*
"When Jimin said ""uhhh"" my thinking went away😹🥵🥵"
LMAOOOO EVERYTHING YOONGI DOES IS TOP TIER COMEDY DHDBEKBXIEBDSJDAUSO
"*""Namjoon I'm the man too!""* namjoon cheering himself is so cute and hot at the same time"
Jungkook is good at everything. That's why he is called the golden maknae. Proud Army!!!!
the thing that i like about JK is he does everything with such passion and with full effort doesn't matter if it is just a game or anything.
"I don’t think Tae has a single ugly photo, I don’t think he even knows what the word ugly means!!"

Slap this video on the faces of people who say BTS lipsync.
The way they hype up the crowd in the beginning & the rock/live band version of their songs...so damn sexy...my Lord  And yoongi’s voice is so deep ..omggggg
*DUDE!! THEIR ENERGY IS NO JOKEEE!! 🤯🤯*
This is the best medley i've ever seen seriously i can't watch without gasping 827383 times
"Hobi looks like a rockstar, blue really is his color 😍"
HOSEOK GAH DAMNNNNNNN 😩😩😩 my biasss
❤❤❤Jimin & Suga❤❤❤
There's something about Hobi and Jin when it comes to Rap/sing in Japanese  Idk what it is but DAMN
"I love this pretty young guys,BTS 💕❤️💜❤️💜💜💜❤️"
"This performance is just something else, definitely one of my favourites from them and I can't even understand why"
My dream is to watch them live 🥺🥺😭
When Jiminy point jungkook body oh yeah I'm so kilig for them purple 💜  you BTS
Damn the vibe is insane and its because of “each member “woah!!! Insane insane 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The one who is the most testing Jin patience is JUNGKOOKKKKKK
"Jin : stoooppp!!!!  Jungkook, Suga, V and Namjoon: so cuteeeee"
"I love jin's screaming/rapping once he gets annoyed, never gets old lmao"
This is why he always gets his revenge by winning all the Run BTS games that he can 😅😂
At this point Jin’s patience is non-existent 😂
""" *Be the eldest hyung they said..* "" "" *It'll be fun they said..* """
"‘Hey, who is your bias?’  ‘Jan.’ ‘Don’t you mean Jin-‘ ‘ *Did I stutter?* ‘"
Nobody irritate jin more then maknae line do 😂
Jinnie doesn't just shout when he's angry he also starts rapping🤣😂😂
"The title should be "" Jin is turing red for 8 min straight ""😂😂😂😂😂😂"
He's ssooo cute the way he scream and rapping when he got pissed
Jin has to take care his 6 super naughty lil brothers and the naughtiest is JUNGKOOK
"Because Jin’s the coolest, non traditional hyung ever."
His patience is so admirable...he be like whining and screaming but love his children dearly..his level of patience is something to be proud of..they are so comfortable around each other that cute😍
Jin is lead rapper at scolding his members😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When JIN is angry he is the BEST RAPPER !
What happened to the birthday slaps and jumping on beds?
0:09  All the members: eeeYYyyYyyyYyyyyYYYyyyyyyYyyYyYyYyYyYyYy  *Flicks the string*  Jin:👁O👁
"They annoys him because they love their jin hyung SOOOO much.    And,    He secretly enjoys that because he loves his 6 annoying little brothers Sooooo much.    Sry for my poor english"
Jin:*does intro Jhope:*does intro Jin: hey sToB it! Taehyung:*does intro Jin: go back to your place!  In the end Jin: TrUsTfRaTeD
i can actually feel seokjin's pain- imagine having to deal with so many Slytherins
1:56  JK: We are becoming one Year Older And Jin’s becoming 30 JN: Why do you need to mention that?
"The way J-hope, Jimin and Jungkook just ran away at the end. They're just children in adult's body"
Justice for Jinnie😔
the fact that he's so witty makes run bts even funnier when he wins or gets angry LOLOL
"He is a rapper but also can break the ceiling with his high note, leJINdary indeed."
Seokjin is the *BEST HYUNG* Ever...
the one dislike is from Jin himself
Seokjin is the *BEST HYUNG* Ever...
Jinnie rapping in pout when he's mad is so cute 🥰😂
_Seokjin is the sweetest and the cutest!!_  in the whole of bangtan       *FIGHT ME*
7:42 so they’re all so freaking cute
"AS the oldest Brother, He has an hard Life😂😂😂😍"
Having 6 kids is hard. I admire Jin's patience. 😂
7:10 I love how SOPE had zero hesitation in leaving jin behind🤣🤣
Jin: *instructing* Jimin: *playing flute intensifies* Jin's patients:ರ_ರ
Jin destroying every Rappers career once he looses his patience .😂 Not related but Jin is so handsome I watched some parts again because he looks so good.
Not to brag or anything but I live in the same planet as jungsoonie and thank you for this vid!
7:05 he said it's fun to see him being so angry 😂😂
"Sis, you just KNOW I clicked faster than my brain works when I saw your notification 😂"
They love jin so much it's so sweet
"6:52 me too Jungkookie, me too. Lol"
Omg!!! Jin’s level of patience💯 he clearly looks annoyed but does not say anything apart from rapping🙌🙌🙌💀💀🤯🤯💜
jin always respond and play along with them thats why they always try to annoy him to get jin's attention 😂. Poor jin hyung 😂
1:08 OK BUT---V'S VOICE😍💜
"The way his ears get red when he is nervous or angry, is cute af 🤩🥰"
Notice how almost all of these are jungkook.
"I love when Jin gets angry , at that time he looks so cute and I like when he scream .but though the other members love him so much 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜borahe BTS"
"The ""go back to your position"" part killed me 😂😂🤣🤣"
Is like me testing my moms patience😂
Me singing Airplane pt. 2 Me: El maria-jin Others : I think the lyric is El Mariach— Me : EL MARIA-JIN ...
the one dislike is from a person who accidently watch this video upside down.
Jin with his friends is literally me and my friends. Just red and raising my voice while they say it’s cute
Voo squishing Jin's face like there's no tomorrow and screaming So Cutee~ is the cutest thing that happened in 2020
*Their love for each other is so adorable 💜💜💜💜💜They love teasing each other and I LOVE THEM* 💜💜💜  *사랑해요* 💜💜💜💜 2:47 He is so cute...
Stob it will forever be iconic😂
They all annoy jin because he loves the kids so much
"Jin is so talented, loving and adorable"
Jin!
This was hilarious. I have a limit of patience for people. Then I get really annoyed. Then I get angry. When the guys gets angry at each other is cute. I never met Jin before and I wouldn't test his patience. I am older than him. I'm not telling you my age. I want you to guess my age. I love Jin. Maybe I'll test his patience level.
"Jungkook is really testing his patience, it reminds me of oldest sibling vs youngest sibling"
They : who's your fav rapper in BTS? Me : Jin They : wh- Me : just make him angry
"The title should be ""Jungkook and others testing Jin's patience"" 🤣😂"
"JK: This year is almost over, we are becoming 1 year older and Jin's becoming 30*  Members: Laugh* Jin: Why do you need to mention that!?! 😂"
And this is how you know he is going to be a very good dad with lots of patience!! 😂
Jin having 6 younger brothers for 8 minutes straight LOL
I'm going to miss these moments when Jin is in the Military :(
3:07 Jin: I didn't tell you to dice it! Namjoon: Mission Fail Successful 😎
I think Jin is so done with his member when they get in Jins nerves
Jin has the cutest scream
jin be like  I said applause not poke me
"And the fourth rapper of BTS has been announced, and of course it's no other than Kim Seokjin!😂😂✋ I love him-"
"3:14 someone does that on me and I look horrible, but of course, it's Jin, he is worldwide handsome so he always looks good"
"The only person I can tolerate myself with listening to complaining, whinning & shouting is JIN💜😍😍😍😊💜😘 I love his little rants."
"Namjoon: ""It's fun to see you(jin) being so angry."" 😂😂😂 same"
No one: EVERY KID ON MUSIC LESSON IN SCHOOL: *quietly plays the recorder in Jimin*
I wish Jin oppa knew International age cus right now he thinks he is becoming old 😂😂
First time I was that early🤠💜
Jin is 29 and he looks like he is 19-25 years our jinie never age💜
Even suga tests his patience and it’s so funny 🤣
*Seokjin is:--* Visual Silver vocalist Manner Idol Kindest soul Caring Loving Thinks about others BEFORE himself... Thinks of ways to make others LAUGH Others *rely on him* always Polite  _&sassy and savage_
i love him sm :)
My jinnoooo is the bestest...... Ultimate bias
"when you're in your sad boi mood but then see the notification and go like 😣😔😟😕🙁😮🙂😊😀😁 thank you very much, love"
"Person- What's the thing you like to do the most? Jungkook- Testing Jin hyung's patience😏. Jin- Stob it, my member bad boi and starts rapping😤. Jungkook- You're old😏. Jin- 👁️👄👁️"
They say that pure hearted people shout easily. And then I see Jin. I confirm the fact. 🥺😍
#Justiceforjin Trend it and protect our jinnie🤧💜.
That 1 dislike is from Jin.
Jungkook have another part time job he always test members patience  jungkoometer 😂💜💜💜💜💜
*Jin interacting with camera* Rest of BTS: It's my time to shine
So funny when jin mad angry 😂😂😂😂
"tannies are the goodest boys and jin never uses the hyung card nor gets angry coz he is a playful person himself but tannies do test his patience a lot , its so endearing to watch loll but he also LOVES them so much and considers them cute just like they love him and see his cuteness so jinn just plays along uwu"
"7:40 reminds me of Jin just being a dad, and 7:45 his sons pranking him 💀"
Jk calling jin why do you not read my comments jin getting how am I supposed to read your comment  Jk in his mind help me help me
I swear Jin's face when they forced him to wear the birthday cap lol
Amazing part is Yoongi is testing Jin patience here!!🤣 not letting him in the Car!!
"1:42 I laughed so much... *Broke the repetition to watch it again and Again..,😂😂🤣💜💜"
"The fact that some Armys think that Jin is a narcissist bc he calls himself WWH. They have that mindset that Jin only thinks about himself. ahckkk!! I'm so disappointed. Especially that REAL armys know that JIN never talks about how he really feels inside and he keeps his emotions bottled up. Have you heard Abyss?!? It doesn't even have 20M views yet. APPRECIATE JIN Y'ALL. But going back to Abyss, he mentioned that he's going deeper in this dark ocean(abyss) and that his voice won't come out. Jin's smile is starting to fade. I think he's not okay. That's why I feel so sad too. He's my happiness and if he's not happy then I'm not too."
jin shows his high vocal skills by his screams also
Rapper Jin is back 1:30
"Hi ARMYs!  Jin love his brothers so much and he always takes care of them, as a dad ^^ who loves Jin 👇👇👇👇👇👇   Share this video if you like it! Thank you for always caring and loving my channel!  👉 👉 👉 Watch More: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-G2ifgfT5M&list=PLjsgRqV955DyObwD2iD2OBZRqm5ZDWe4r"
True fact: Jin is the best hyung in the whole kpop industry...
*JIN'S LIFE* :  _When you're yourself a BABY but have to take care of 6 more BABIES_
"Jimin: Hyung... we're all you've got, right?  Jin: You guys are all I've got  😭😭💜💜"
"Jin is cute a handsome, he takes care of them like they are all babies and he is the father of his kids...real hyung🥺 we love him"
None can't imagine BTS without Jin he knows his 6 brothers very well he was caring loving and supporting his 6 brothers too much he is the good brother #jinhyung
Jungkook - Something is burning. Jimin - No I can't smell Jungkook - My heart is burning Jimin - From where did you learnt it Jungkook - From Jin hyung 💜💜💜💜
Without Jin BTS is so boring not only Jin others also in all day he making BTS and army's happy with his daddy jokes he is really world wide handsome JIN #jin
Who loves WORLD WIDE HANDSOME JIN 👇💜
He is very good person and He takes care of everyone like his elder brother 😘😘
*Seokjin is:--* Visual Silver vocalist Manner Idol Kindest soul Caring Loving Thinks about others BEFORE himself... Thinks of ways to make others LAUGH Others *rely on him* always Polite  Respectful _&sassy and savage_
"Jin is like a friend , hyung and parent of BTS. He always protected the members💜"
"Jin is the most perfect man to ever exist. He is too handsome, sings really well, takes care of everyone and everything, and his personality is really good!!!! STAN KIM SEOKJIN 🥰🌟🌟"
Jin:  i am world wide handsome u know  U all are beautiful but not more than me u know U all are cute but not more than me u know  I am WORLD WIDE HANDSOME u know  World wide cutie guy  World wide funny guy U KNOW
The fact is that you may not find out right many clips like this because Jin is an introvert he doesn't show it on camera but as Tae always says Jin worries a lot about them and cares for them at the back .  And please respect him .
"How can someone be this perfect? He is caring, a good cook, has a heart of gold. He is  handsome like a prince and humourous. Fill me in if I am missing something."
Jin has always encouraged them that it will all pay off looks like we did it💃
Jin in white short sleeve shirt with a bok in his hand was looking like all the wealthiest young men in the world whole worldwide
Jin is literally the best hyung ever ☺💜💜
"Thinking that he's the youngest in his family but still he take care to bts so well, and have really close relationship like a buddh with the youngest on (jk) despite of age gap, always brighten others day and spreading positivity despite having hard days for himself  We know everyone have a 'dark side' so does bts but I never saw jin's he's just like a parent just want to give good and happiness to their child no matter how much they suffer inside"
"8:00 I always say that and I repeat, Jin is comfort, Jin is home, a kind and caring friend. Love him so much."
BTS is not there without jin caring and loving😭❤️
Our world wide handsome jin  Takes care of everyone ❤️.

The best hyung in k-pop world 🥺🤧💜💜💜
Jin is the older in the group...but for me jin is the younger
He is the best elder sibling anyone could have ever asked for🥺💜
I can't imagine BTS with out Jin..His role to the group is such inspiration to all..He is a very nice guy..
"Jin , really is the glue that keeps them together. 💜"
"""One day I'll have to leave my six flowers and millions of butterflies"". I hope that day never comes Jin. I'll love you to the moon and never back. Oh wait! You are our moon."
Jin putting rj with jhope. Like he is giving his comfort and support throug rj😍🥺
If there was a award for the best father in the entire world it would go to Jin 👏🤓
jin makes me veryyyyyyyyyyy happy even tho his kinda weird
"One day,we will woke up with one; Last mv Last era Last song Last dance Last voice Last move Last cry Last laugh Last touch of mic Last performance on stage Last award Last confetti Last concept Last tour Last concert Last happiness Last bow And last """"ANNYEONGHASEYO BANGTAN SONYEONDAN IMINIDA""""  How can we bare this army🥺 Oh my heartu😭"
"JIN : _so done with BTS_  *Also JIN* : playing with them, take care of them , and loving them.  _Also JIN_ : mad and start RAP 😂😂🤣🤣"
Jin is such a darling 🤗🤗🤗. Worldwide Handsome. Purple you sooo much💜💜💜
Seokjin is the *BEST HYUNG* Ever...
"I will say this once again, Yoongi, Hobi, Namjoon, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook are so lucky to have a hyung like Jin."
Jin is lovely and very caring. I like how he looks after his beloved hyungs 💙
Who agree Jin is the best hyung in the world ✋💜💜
"🌿 Jin has always been "" the Dad""..."
Bts whenever they are confused or having a trouble  Jin HyUnng................   They know that their Jin hyung will be always there for them. I love their brotherhood.
*Another title* : _SEOKJIN HYUNG with 6 EVIL MAKNAE_
"BTS you all are so cute ,handsome and sweet"

I have notice one thing jhope saying let's give clap for member. He start clapping thing mostly.i don't other do that but I mostly see him starting
that's the reason that he is my Bias 😉😍😍😍😍
Off topic but did anyone else see a glitching ad when jungkook and jin were singing spring day🧐
"Jin, nosso Príncipe Coreano, é maravilhoso!!!!! 🥰😍😀❤"
FAKE MAKNAE : KIM SEOK JIN 😁
No one :           Me : I wish Jin was my older brother
The fact that he's the youngest from his family yet he's the best big brother for bts <3
He's the best hyung to his members because Jin treat them like brothers as always took care of them 💜🥺
that “Pls use BTS to love ur self” 🥺💓
We can literally write a whole book about jin being the best hyung.
"*Jin When camera is on:I love you guys!* *Jin When camera is off:Okay, and now. WHO ATE LAST COOKIE?! YOU JK?! BITCH!! COME HERE*    I love them"
jin the oldest member: ahh I'm not afraid I'm not afraid   jin later that time: save me from this 6 idiots
My fav words of jin saying World Wide Handsome
"His the elder brother for the other bts, very considearte, compassionate, protective, kind, n care all his younger brothers in bts...salut..👍"
7:02 the way Jimin looking at RM eating that banana 🍌 🤣🤣🤣 and 10:47 that iconic Jin dance 🥰🥰🥰
no-one: litrally no-one: Not even RM's lost airpods: youtube: Lets give a notifacation after 4 minutes!
Jin is not only handsome he is so kind and caring I always wanna see them together our 7 king look cute and strong together❤❤😋
He always takes cares of his small brothers..He always try to make them happy..He loves them a lot..He is so caring and loving hyung..😊💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"9:41 I keep going back to when Jin showed up.. so relieved ""our reliable Jin-hyung is here, everything will be okay now Jungkook-ah""  Jin being calm, I think really helped them then, especially baby maknae..  BTS 4ever 💜💜💜"
"Me first No views, 3 likes, 2 comments that I can't see, Mee:😂😂😂😂😂😂❓"
I really like the video and  Fun FACT : You are seeing namjin so much in this video and you love that
Feeding his brothers first and then he eats the last. It's so cute and caring. Also taking care of all the other members. The girl gets to marry him is very lucky 😭😱😍💜
I think it was hard for Jin to handle V and Jk hahahaha
he is very  good  person and  he  takes care  of everyone like his elder brother 😘
Saranghae world wide handsome 💜
They are not just a band or a group of friends. They are family holding tight onto each other.
Everyone needs a jin their life😭💜
Jin is really brings inspiration and motivates the people around him including me 😊 thanks jin
aside from all their achievement JINs greatest achievement is the love and respect he gain from his 6 brothers.. all the happy memories he made with them is priceless 💜
Seokjin you're adorable in all moments      I love him💜💜
Jin The oldest Hyung The fake maknae The worldwide handsome  The foodie ARMY’s and BTS love 💜 Kim Seokjin love youuuu ❤️❤️
Jin is awesome..Always taking care of his guys.
Everyone should have a Jin in their life... Really..! 💜💜💜💜💜
Jin we all love you 💜💜
Jin is really caring & awesome too 😉
CUTEEEE.......
"Jin: Armys call me Eomma, I'm not gonna care for these 6 kids now. 😡 Me: you sure about that!?? 😌"
Jin is a kind and inocent soul🥺🥺🥺
Our one and only Seokjin. 💜
He is the mom of the group so- im proud to be this wwh fan-
I love how namjoon appreciates his hyung everytime he gets a chance. I really love Namjin💜💜
KIM NAMJOON KIM SEOKJIN MIN YOONGI JUNG HOSEOK PARK JIMIN KIM TAEHYUNG JEON JUNG KOOK 💜💜 BTS 💜💜😂 quet lol 💜😂😂
"Jk: três, dois, um VAAI 🇧🇷🤧 0:52"
"I don't have a brother i only have two sisters. I don't feel I need a brother. But seeing bts I wish I have bro. Specially jin he is really a best brother they all deserve 💜.  They all are soo happy to get a brother like. He change his personality for each member. Like with maknaeline he become like them with suga,jhope,rm he become like mature brother. They all so lucky. Iam getting emotional 🥺 to see his care for members specially how he make jk laugh with his childish😍🥺💜"
Jin hyung is the most down to earth person I have ever seen. He being from a rich family never showed off his wealth or took benefits rather helped other members in the initial days and even till today's date and the future ahead no one's compare to him.
He is the best person I ever meet in my life.
🥺okay the greatest line when RM said use me to love urself n that came from Jin like wooooooooowww Jin has always taught me how to love enjoy one own self idk how much greatful I am to discover him
Our WWh is so friendly boy wanna hug u kiss u 7 kings 👑 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜

Yo muriendo en los primeros 40 segundos al ver a Tae con su pelo enchinado
Jungkook se estresó con las botellas😂😂
"Jimin es tan atlético! Las actividades que no eran cuestión de suerte sino de técnica las pasó de inmediato. Wow, sin duda es cinturón negro en taekwondo, practicó esgrisma japonesa y mucho más como acrobacias. Además, es muy perseverante y lógico, siempre trató de mantener en calma. Realmente es admirable 👏🏻 Seguramente va a ser el primero en irse."
"Yo estaba ""lpm,juego de m....,déjame ir a los nenes Yoongi con el pelito largo,tae con el pelo rizado,jimin con el pelo negro son mi perdición literal"

"29:53........Tae su carita toda ternura de ""toy solito"" 💜 Gracias!!! he reído mil después de un día super estresante de trabajo 😘"
"Sentí pena por suga, pobresito mi amor, yo te entiendo bebe."
Jin subiéndose a la mesa: RM: vayamos a ver xdxd.
Yoongi todo frustrado da ternura :3
*36:10** Jimin y Jungkook fallecieron* Yo:WeY nOoOoOOoOoOo
"Gracias por la traducción,ellos se divierten en cada juego y le ponen corazón y ternura a todo,ay amigas armys,ya mi esposo esta celoso,que solo paso viendo a los Coreanos,como les dice él ☺ jijijipero ya le dije que espero para el 14 de febrero,mi regalo,el peluche de Tae,a tata!😍🤗💜❤"
Este Run fue tan divertido JAJAJAJA Todos sabemos que Jungkook irá a casa primero verdad? Jajajaja
Suga se ve tan hermoso lo extrañe y su cabello largo lo amo❤️✨
"X: _Che, y que cosas suele hacer el líder de Bts?_ Yo: **Recordando el minuto **3:58** y a Jin diciendo: **_Namjoon, no los rompas_**** 34:57😂😂"
Su risa de BB de kookie 🍪💕 aww es tan tierna 6:15
"*2:09* _J-Hope, ¿No quieres vender la camiseta?_  (...)  _Sería una buena blusa de pijama._  Yo: LO COMPRO AAAAAAAAAA"
24:00 pobre de JIN hay q tener paciencia!
Me escantan que tu te esfuerces por levantarte temprano para subir un video y ma encanto tu cambio de logo 🥰
Valió la pena la desvelada como siempre 💛✨
"JAJAJAJAJAJA todo comenzó cuando Suga no podía ganar y me moría de risa  por sus berrinches, luego Jin y terminó con Jungkook por las botellas jajajjajjajja ahhhh que  lindo run, me impresionó jimin al girar el ula ula (así lo llamamos aquí)"
"20:07 OMG me encantó el grito de yoongi , quede tiesa 💜"
Soy la única que sufrió viendo como le costaba todo a yoongi 🥺😢😢??
A yoongi le hace falta practicar su Nen 😌😌 muy pocas entenderán
"A alguien mas le encanta cuando j-hope dise ""ash"" XD jsjsjsjsj"
Luego de este Run planearon ir a para In the soop 😍
36:22 mi amor tan bello todo mechudito del Su cabello
"En este Run todos me mataron de la ternura, son tan lindoooo, quiero casarme con JIMIIIIIIIN😍😍"
Sigo sin superar a Suga intentando poner la pelotita en el cesto y que no podia con los juegos Mientras el JK ganando enseguida  jsjsj. Psdt: La fotito de j-hope y V jsjs encantadoras.
Toobin (creó que se llamaba así) el conejito de TXT se coló en el RUN😁
"Camisetas jikook, ahora vhope esperemos al Namjin + yoongii"
En todo el run  Me: modo Suga. .....pase gritando. ... Aunque también rei...me desesperé. .hay nooo no se ustedes ARMYS pero es uno de los mejores run. ...ya quiero la otra parte. ... Gracias X la traducción 💜💜
me encanta q cuando yoongi o hobi tienen q jugar un juego que es de dos personas se llaman el uno al otro inmediatamente
En el minuto 19:57 pongo la misma cara que V cuando pierdo un juego. xd
0:26 ahí en la esquinita sale Tobin 💜
En el minuto 37:32 podemos ver a un Kim Namjoonie chikito.
yoongi diciendo hoba me dio ganas de seguir viviendo
38:19 ese juego fue parte de mi infancia 🥺👍💜 ..Bellos mis bebes !! 💜🔮🌟
Los gritos sexyssss de sugaaa AHHHHHHHHHH.
Ah gracias en serio ....suga es tan lindo todos son bellos
Yoongi haciendo berrinches es mi nueva religión
"Los que le dieron dislike, ¿todo bien en casa?"
El que más sufrió fue Sugita...me encanta como se enoja. Y Jungkook pasó todo rápido es impresionante su inteligencia física. Jimin ah es una ternurita. RM uso su inteligencia con pegar el vaso y anotar la pelotita ;)
Tae y Suga con bandanas y Tae con el pelo rizado me tienen muerta en el suelo ❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😙
Woow!! Q hermoso despertar y tener semejante cap!!!! Mil gracias x la traduccion!!! Gracias x su gran esfuerzo y dedicacion!!!💜 I Love you💜
Gatito es mi bias por muchas razones y hoy me mató de ternura.
"Los gritos de Suga me sorprendieron nunca lo escuche gritar asi :v, son los unicos berrinches que soportaria"
Jimin es asombroso lo hizo el ultimo desafio es un chico prodigio y genial sus 8 años de entrenamiento de esgrima Japonesa dieron sus frutos. Haciendolo que lograra el ultimo desafio.😍💪👍
JAJAJAJAJAJAJA JINN NO PODIA HACERLO OBVIAMENTEEEE PORQUE NO ESTABA DE FRENTE.
Nunca olvidare a 7 personas que cambiaron mi vida porque llenaron mi viada : 1- la llenaron de esperanza. 2- la llenaron de alegria. 3- la llenaron con enseñansas 4- la llenaron con armonia  5 - llenaron con paz.  6- purificaron my vida. 7- me hicieron reflexionar para volverme una mejor persona . Agradesco mucho el aver tomado este camino y no me arrepiento de ser ARMY y estoy muy orgullosa de serlo y de todo lo que aprendi gracias a ellos me quiero a mi misma .# ARMY FOR EVER.
"No importa que se parta la tierra en dos o qué ellos se casen , no importa si cumplen 50 años y tienen 3 hijos , no importa que todos me juzguen por ser ARMY , con ellos me quedo hasta que el universo termine y las estrellas dejen de brillar por que lo que ellos hicieron por mi y por tod@s los armys no se olvida, esa es mi promesa 🖤♾BTS FOREVER 💜💜💜💜💜💜"
Quien más mero llora😢😢😢  ojala BTS renueve su contrato con big hit así nosotras las A.R.M.Y. no suframos por ellos😢😢
Soy la única que lloró pensando en el momento en el que pase eso!😢😔😔💔💔💔💜💜💔💔💔
Alguien no lloro ? Yo sii;cc(no creí q iba a tener likes😂)
"Yo- No se vayan, no sabria que hacer con mi p*uta vida. BTS- Vas a crear tu propia vida y volveras hacer feliz."
Yo ya no soy Army pero jamas voy a olvidar esos momentos en los que esperaba a que mi mamà fuera a la hacienda para poner las canciones de bts a todo volumen y cantarlas a todo pulmon
Por eso armys no se ilusiinen toda cosa tiene su final lamentablemente U_U
Soy solo yo o me salio lagrimas 😢😭 Army   BTS FOREVER
Wey Llore Pero... Una verdadera ARMY se queda hasta el final sin importar q pasen los dias semanas años o siglo Siempre estaremos para ellos como ellps estan para nosotr@s 🎵❤️🤩👏🎤
Ellos no podrán estar en nuestras vidas pero si en nuestro corazón 💕 ARMY por siempre 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Armys seamos fuertes por ellos la banda que nos cambio la vida 😢😢😣😖
Este es uno de los videos que pueden hacer llorar a Army en segundos :'c
No sé si Army esté lista para ese triste momento 🥺😓😓😓😓
"¡ARMYS!🚨BTS podrá aplazar su servicio militar gracias a nueva ley en Corea del Sur. Casi todos los hombres sanos del país deben servir en el Ejército durante 18 meses antes de cumplir los 28 años, pero el parlamento aprobó un proyecto que permite a las estrellas del k-pop posponer esta obligación."
Si hay algo que  yo como army nunca me olvidaré será la 😥 frase de RM;Cuéntanos tu historia.🤗 Se las contaré a ustedes entonces 😓.; Yo no sabía porque seguía viva 🙁hasta que RM también dijo ; Amense. 😙 Quiero pedirles un favor grandísimo a ustedes army .🤗😀 Ya somos todxs como una familia para BTS😄.  Si uno de ellos no sobreviven en el servicio militar😟 ...recordemoslo como nuestro  Héroe. 😁 Como nuestra única esperanza de vivir .😊😔 Cuando me uni al fandom   no entendía ni que hacía metida en este fandom😞... poco a poco entendí que era mi momento de seguir con vida ..😥.apoyandolos desde lejos..😋.al igual que algunas ARMYS se otros países o ciudades que no vivan en Corea del Sur..🙃. espero este mensaje les llegue al corazón al igual que a mi ahora escribiendo esto ..😢.también espero que si algo les llegue a pasar no entremos en la depresión 😭😭o no lleguemos a comer sólo porque se murió..😭😢💔. no se olviden de la canción i nedd you de BTS y life goes on de BTS tan bien 😭 I love purple💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"Army aun nos queda tiempo ya dejan de pensar en eso y disfrutemos todos esos momentos que vamos a tener con ellos,creemos historias y Recuerdos,que el mundo sepa quienes somos,Bts y army siempre sera lo mejor que me paso en la vida 💜 Hagamos historia todos juntos VIVA BTS ,VIVA ARMY!!!💜"
Yo:no quiero que os vayáis por favor. BTS:lo siento pero no podemos . Yo: porque no podéis? BTS:porque si no lo hacemos nuestro jefe se enfadara y cada uno se va del grupo.
"Pienso que si es verdad que algun dia bts se separara, pero... ¿No te parece que en los momentos felizes recuerdas los momentos malos de tristeza?  La verdad, esque estube viedo memes y cosas demasiado graciosas de bts asta que me tope con este video y estoy hartA de que siempre que me saquen una sonrisa bts, me tope con videos asin en el momento donde me sienta feliz.  No siempre ahi que estar tristes y recordar el ano 2030. Ahora que estamos en 2021, aprobecha y sonrie con ellos  ¿Acaso ves a bts recordando el ano 2030?  Ellos hacen que nos riamos y sonriamos y no recordemos cosas tan penosas  En mi opinion: no me parece que hagan estos video es medio de la dibersion😒😭🙄"
Apenas soy army y ya me estoy preocupando por si llegara ese dia
Lo peor es que por ellos estoy viva y feliz no se que haré cuando se separen no tendre una motivación para vivir por que ellos eran esa motivación
A toda army nos asusta q un día este sueño q es tan hermoso se acabe  ellos nos an echo felices por 7 años y nos dieron su juventud  pero nosotras debemos vivir  nuestra vida felices y queriendo nos a nosotras mismas en nombre de ellos por q eso nos enseñaron y aunq nisiquiera sabían q existieramos con simplemente mostrarnos su sonrisa éramos felices y lo seremos no importa que  ARMY por soempre
No no digas eso Me hace llorar demasiado No quiero que BTS se separe Ni se vayan porque mi vida sin ellos no será la misma 😭 Quiero decirle a BTS Gracias por enseñarme que me tengo que armar que tengo que luchar por mi futuro Y que nunca los dejaré de amarlos  Nunca dejare que se vayan 😭😭😞
No importa que se separen yo siempre los recordaré ARMY por siempre 💜💜💜
"*la intro: *Año 2030 * *X: por qué ya no sonríes *  Yo automáticamente: *Pausa el vídeo * Mira... déjame te explique, hace 11 años atrás, había un grupo de K-pop llamado BTS su contrato se había terminado, pero su agencia les hizo otro contrato por 7 años más.... Esos chicos evocaban amor, felicidad, sonrisas con solo el echo de verlos atraves de una pantalla... Su contrato se acabó hace 4 años...y desde que se separaron, no he tenido una razón para volver a sonreír. ｡:ﾟ(;´∩`;)ﾟ:｡ Sin ellos ya nada es igual, sabía que ese momento iba a llegar y trate de prepararme.... pero la verdad, nunca estube lista, llegó el momento y fue como si me hubiesen separado mi corazón de mi cuerpo... ¿Entiendes?....ellos eran lo único que tenía, que me hacían sonreír, que me mantenían con la cabeza en alto...  (-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩___-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩)"
"Vuelvan a la realidad,lo bueno dura poco. Si ese momento llega,creerán que su vida se derrumbara,que ya no habrá nada que los haga felices a ustedes,pero no es así,siempre hay esperanzas,más si se trata de felicidad. Tienen todo el derecho a sentirse mal,a llorar y a pensar que nada los hará felices,pero no tienen el derecho a perder las esperanzas. Ese derecho nos los quito BTS. Seamos felices con ellos hasta que llegue ese día,donde ya no caminaremos con ellos,pero ahí seguiremos. Los quiero~^^."
Yo digo que cuando los chicos se separen que cada uno tenga un canal de Youtube jejejeje ok no -rio pa no llorar-
Armys no se pongan tristes BTS Jamás será olvidado nosotras debemos seguir apoyando en todo  armys no estén tristes BTS será recordado
Yo viendo el video en clase virtual. Yo- {llorando} El profesor- Todo bien¿¿¿
Ellos nunca se van a separar porque nosotras las armys siempre los apoyaremos
"Díganme qu no soy la única que está llorando viendo este video y más porque todo lo que dice es verdad   Yo recién me uni al fandom hace 5 meses pero soy super feliz y conozco muy bien al grupo , ellos me enseñaron a ser mejor persona , a entender a la gente , a no discriminar ni hacer menos a nadie, a respetar , a sonreír,  a quererme a mi misma y no se que haga cuando se separen pero si se que nunca lo olvidaré ni menos los dejaré de apoyar 😔🤧😢😢😢"
Esas personas que cambiaron todo mi mundo siempre los  llevaré en mi mente y en mi corazón y mientras estén con nosotras/os cuidemolos y amenlos con toda su fuerza A.R.M.Y
Yo solo estoy feliz por que aún que no estén tan comunicados con nosotr@s y no estén juntos como banda ellos van a seguir llevándose y van a estar juntos y me pone muy bien eso y imagínense que hagan una segunda era con sus hijos como dijo jimin seria tan hermoso pero bueno si me disculpan me voy a llorar .💕    Ed: los amo ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💕💕💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Nada mas pienso en en eso y no quiero que jamas se separen  😢😢😢 SON LA MEJOR BANDA KPOP QUE E CONOCIDO ARMY NO ESTAMOS LISTAS PARA ESTE MOMENTO PERO A BTS NUNCA LOS ALBIDAREMOS 💞
Jamás los olvídare ellos para mí son todos i love you BTS 😘
Bueno me voy a llorar con permiso
"Se*, “sé” con tilde es de saber: “sé que bts no sabe ni siquiera mi existencia”."
Nunca los voy a olvidar porque cambiaron mi vida
"Con permiso, me voy a llorar ;-;"
No quiero que llege el día pero SIEMPRE ESTARAN ES NUESTROS CORAZONES EN EL DE TODAS LAS ARMYS 💕
Se podrán separar pero  siempre los unirá el lazo divino del amor de la más grande amistad🙏🙏😇😇😇😇😇😇😇💕💕💕💕👍🤘🇪🇨
"BTS ha marcado un inicio, un cambio mundial es dificil pensar en que algun dia tendran que cambiar de rumbo, pero todos evolucionamos y es necesario, agradecer por cada palabra de aliento que nos da con sus canciones, quedará eternamnte en mi corazón. 😍😍✌😊"
Alguien más está llorando por que yo sí ojalá que siempre esten juntos ❤️❤️
"Aunque se separen nunca olvidaré las sonrisas, el amor, la enseñanza, el amor a mi misma ni que ellos me hicieron una mejor persona muchas gracias por todo las Armys sabemos     que este amor y esas sonrisas llegarán a su final porque ellos cres eran y no podrán hacer lo que hacen ahorita, se casaran y puede ser que tengan hijos pero nunca olvidaremos las buenas personas que nos han hecho a mis hermanas y ami y tal vez a ustedes también, pero si se van y tienen hijos mi deseo es que sigan los pasos de su padre porque lo llevara a un mundo muy hermoso y lindo como ellos lo tienen ahora. Muchas gracias BTS por hacerme una mejor persona los amo demasiado y nunca los dejaré de amar, ni de admirar, ni de querer. Aunque sean los últimos días de mi vida los seguiré apoyando, y gracias por ponerme un ejemplo en mi vida y les prometo que cuando tenga hijos les enseñaré a ser buenas personas como ustedes lo hicieron conmigo LOS AMOOOO!!!! nunca los olvidaremos porque SOMOS. #B❤️T❤️S❤️❤️Y❤️❤️A❤️R❤️M❤️Y❤️💮F💮O💮R💮E💮V💮E💮R💮😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😊😊😊😊💜💜💜❤️❤️❤️💮💮💮🤗🤗🤗😒"
"Lo unico que se esque gracias a ellos pase la mejor experiencia de mi vida que permanecera siempre junto a mí y los recordare como los 7 chicos que cambiaron mi vida y dedicaron su juventud para hacerlo , nunca me arrepentire de aver formado de un fandon extraordinario con un lider unico y gracias a sus enseñansas de el y de los demas integrantes .# ARMY FOR EVER."

Tenemos que aprovechar el tiempo que nos queda por qué no durará para siempre 🥺🥺
Ay que disfrutar los 6 años más que nos quedan con BTS! no estén tristes ;)
"como una vez dijo Efrain Ruales ""no estoy lista para eso "" no se army pero si ese dia llega tendremos que escuchar y ver sus antiguos  conciertos y llorar y llorar 💔   #army forever"
Yo cuando empece el video: *No me va a afectar* Yo después: *lloranding*
"Y como chingados no quieren que llore, tan viendo que soy bien pinshe sentimental y me vienen con esto😢😭"
Debemos entenderlo sé que es un poquito difícil para todas para todas las armis Pero bueno Hay que aceptarlo como es aún así que nos duela demasiado chao chicas no puedo más
¿Soy la única que está llorando y más cuando llegue ese momento? 🤧💜
"Lo único que le pido a la vida es ir a un concierto de ellos, aunque sea solo una vez. Es mi único deseo. 🐈"
No importa todo lo que pase BTS siempre estará para todas las ARMYS no importa que se casen que tengan hijos que tengan 50 años ellos siempre siempre estarán para tod@s nosotr@s BTS forever armys para toda La vida no importa que life goes on- la vida continúe siempre estarán ahí  y también tod@s los que amamos BTS
"Es triste pero real, es algún momento ellos se separaran y tomarán caminos distintos,unos seguirán de solistas ,otros actores o tal ves formen su propio familia cada uno de ellos,pero estemos seguros que ellos fueron todo para nosotros y para ellos fuimos todo y que apesar de la distancia fuimos uno solo ,y que aunque se separen seguiremos siendo ARMY para siempre. Hay que hacer una promesa de que cuando nosotros tengamos nuestra propia familia hablarle de esas 7 personas que nos cambiaron la vida, que nos salvaron, que nos sintieron ser feliz y que nos hicieron saber que primero hay que amarse a uno mismo antes de amar a alguien más, saber que todas las personas son hermosas y que esos defectos esos pequeños defectos son lo que hacen bell@ y unic@ a cada persona.  Que ellos nos dieron una gran lección de vida y nunca los olvidaremos.  Prometanlo🤚🤙♥️🥰😘"
Habeses me imagino como sera mi vida cuando ya ellos no estén.... Armys no ay que ponernos tristes al contrario ay que aprovechar cada momento que estemos juntos para llevarlos todo el tiempo  con nosotrxs
"Yo no lloraré, porque si ellos son felices yo también lo seré :3"
Estos chicos me hicieron la visaa muy feliz el momento en que se separen yo siempre estare con ellos no solo yo si no tambien army si me disculpan me voy a llorar T.T
"Si llega ese dia me voy a encerrar y voy a desaparecer minimo una semana de la vida, voy a estar ocupada llorando y escuchando la cancion de jimin cua do lo despertaron y el no c queria levantar de la cama en resumes super triste"
ME HIZO LLORAR Y YO NO QUIERO QUE SE SEPAREN PERO YO SE QUE UN DIA SE TIENEN QUE SEPARAR AUN QUE ARMY  NO QUIERA Y LOS VAMOS A EXTRAÑAR A BTS LOS AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ATT: ARMY
Me llega un sentimiento horrible cuando pienso en la separacion de los chicos.😭 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
espero que eso nunca pase pero toda army sabemos que va a pasar si lamentablemente si😭😭😭😭😭😟
Ojalá nunca llegue el momento en el que ellos se tengan que separar pq las Armys sufriremos peor que ellos tanta felicidad que ellos nos an brindado 😥tantos momentos felices pero algún día ellos se separan es algo que nosotras tenemos que aceptar
ARMYS espero cuando BTS termine nosotr@s sigamos de pie  #BTS#ARMY#FOREVER Espero que no rompamos nuestra promesa que hicimos cuando entramos al fandom .Por que tengo que recordarles algo que somos ARMY y ARMY nunca da la cara hacía bajo 👌👌👌 # ARMY#BTS#FOREVER
"Yo misma me jure que no me iba a encariñar con ellos, que solo hiva a escuchar su musica nada mas.pero aqui me tienen llorando por ellos😭😭😭"
El camino que decidan tomar ya sea por separado o juntos 🥺🤧😭los seguiremos a donde sea que vayan seguiremos siendo sus army🤧😭
BTS OJALA QUE NUNCA LLEGUE ESE MOMENTO PERO SI LLEGARA A PASAR YO SEGUIRE SIENDO ARMI DE CORAZÓN BTS LOS AMO COMO NO SE LO IMAGINAN ARMIS TENEMOS QUE APOYAR A BTS PORQUE BTS ES LA ÚNICA BANDA QUE NOS ASE FELIZ LAS AM9 ARM¥S ESPERO QUE SIEMPRE SEAMOS ARM ¥S FOREVER LAS AMO...BTS SIEMPRE ESTARÁN EN MI CORAZÓN LOS AMO
Estoy llorando porque no feliz que ellos van a ser tan lindos como siempre me dicen que no hay nada que hacer que no se vean tan solo que no quiero que se vean tan mal
"Alguien mas está  llorando? 🤧🤧 La verdad es que bts es todo para mí ,ellos me levantaron de una que otra caída que di ,ellos me enseñaron a amarme a mi misma y nunca rendirme luchar por mis sueños y las verdad es que son parte de mi vida y ocupan cada uno de ellos en mi corazón un gran lugar que nadie renplasaria jamás 🤧🤧❤️💕"
"Este es uno de los vídeos más tristes sobre bts, nunca estaré preparada para cuando ellos se separen :'v 😢😢😭😭"

Por mas que muera jamas de los jamases me voy a olvidar de los sietes magnificos que alegraron mi vida... Mis sietes estrellas favoritas las cuales siempre atesorare... BTS FOREVER..
Me who doesnt know what bts is: ;w;  Also me: AM I THE ONL ENGLISH ONE HERE-
Éstoy llorando😭😭😭😭
Todos sabemos que ese momento llegara y tod@s gritemos ARMYS PARA SIEMPRE SIEMPRE LLEVARE EN MI CORAZON A USTEDES BTS💖
"Yo, como ARMY, prometo nunca olvidar y dejar de apoyar a estás personas y prometo amarlas durante toda mi vida, hasta que muera ✋"
SOLO CON VER LA FECHA MIS OJOS EXPLOTARON QUE HARÉ SIN ELLOS QUIEN ME HARÁ LLORAR REÍR AMAR QUIEN ME ANIMARÁ CON QUIEN ME DIVERTÍ RE CUANDO ENTRE AL CANAL DE ELLOS NO HABRÁ NADA NUEVO QUIEN NOS DARÁ ESAS CANCIONES HERMOSAS AYYY ES QUE DUELE TANTO ESPERO QUE HAYA MUERTO ANTES DE QUE PASE 😭😭😭😭🙏
Nunca superare a BTS siempre los tendré en mi corazón y meda mucha tristeza pensar q todo se acabara y el dia q eso pase no dejare de llorar y espero q nunca se olviden de esas 7 personas q nos hicieron reir y amarnos
Yo creo que cuando se separen se van a extrañar por que cuando Jhope grabó chicken noodle soup dijo que los extrañaba y cuando suga fue a operarse decían que extrañaba a suga pero yo creo que como quiera se van a mandar mensajes hablaremos juntarse con sus esposas e hijos
"Yo illendo a corea Mi mejor amiga : LO LOGRASTE VE VE  Y CORRE Y SALVA BTS JAJAJAJA .... llevalos aka luna por mi ok ??? :""c"
"Empecé hace muy poco a admirarlos, a amar su música y no me denominó army por el momento, pero sí que llore más que cuando mi crush me dijo que empezó a pololear :'( voy a seguir llorando, con permiso"
Nunca podré olvidarlos y nunca los sacaré de mi corazón 💖
Lloré todo el vídeo:( No me imagino vivir sin ellos
"Algún día nos tendremos que separar BTS Y ARMY,pero ese día no va a  ser hoy ni nunca #BTS#ARMY#FOREVER# LOS AMO ARMYS"
Cundo bi el vídeo llore y no sé cómo pero estoy escribiendo esto yo tengo miedo de que ese día yege tengo mucho miedo no no sé cómo seria mi vida sin ellos riéndose y pasándola bien no sé cómo viviré sin la risa de Jin la carita de suga de RM como el papá de todos como jk un bebesito y a Jimin con sus caídas y a hobi sonreír y a v cantar y pasarla bien  creo que desde ese momento mi vida dará un canvio muy radical para siempre y por siempre no sé cómo viviré mi entras escribo esto me estoy imaginando ese momento y estoy en crisis estoy llorando pero perdón que no escriba bien pero es por esto 😞 yo creo que ya no boy a se la misma nunca más cunado pase eso la verdad no sé si tendré la fuerza para enfrentar esos momentos de crisis no se cómo lo boy a Aser😭😢😓😭😔😟😢😥😞😣😩😫😿
No quiero que ese dia pase y jamas pero jamas voy a olvidar lo feliz que me hicieron LOS AMO BTS
Se que para las ARMYS esto es muy triste pero tenemos que reconocerlo BTS no durara para siempre en los ecenarios pero si en nuestros corazones asi que ARMYS apoyemonos entre nosotras😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😥

"PERO yo sé que vamos a seguir queriendolos como unas verdaderas armys Ow,O"

How many did you get right? (Be Honest!)
*Lia* - talking about how she likes to listen to Dynamite at night   *Yuna* - Danananananayeah
I like Yuna's hair like thisssss 🥺🥰
Lia speaking Korean: cutieeee  Lia speaking English: probably like one of the hottest voice I've ever listened...
Why is no one talking about Yuna's visual? I really like her hair and her dress
I like Lia leading this segment she looks so confident.
*No one:* *When Dalla Dalla's melody was played:* *Yeji:* I don't know this song *Ryujin:* I'm so confused *Lia:* Like this is very famous oh yeah Pretending not to know their own song is just so *cute :)*
I know Yeji is the leader but Lia and Ryujin both give me leader vibes
So no ones gonna talk about how Yeji's outfit damnnn it fits her so much especially the red lipstick
Lia speaking English: 👩🏻👠💃💄 Lia speaking Korean: 👧🏻🧚‍♀️🌸😸
Y is no one talking abt ryujin literally guessing the songs right away
"yuna talking about twice: she makes me melt me: me too girl, me too"
Lia: “half of my heart is in-* Also Lia: *messes lyrics up* “sorry lyrics problem”  Every international fan trying to sing to korean songs: *relatable*
Lia in the middle wearing the blouse look like she's the principle's daughter with her besties in a party at a school in canada. Yeah😎
Okay but Yuna with wavy hair is the move
No one: Confuse  Filipino Fans be like: The melody sounds like the selecta team song
lia getting angry when she couldn’t recognize the song even though the members already said it is HILARIOUS
10:24  Yeji: i don’t know this song Ryujin: im so confused  Jisoo: but this are very famous song *being english gurrrllss*  Yuna and Chaeryeong: *singing without noticing the conversation between unnies*
"Lia has a main character energy ngl, even at dancing u can already spot her quickly (not in a bad way of course)"
"ryujin saying ""itsss team"" is so cute"
LIA is more confident in ENGLISH type shows......
"Nobody: ITZY when they get their songs in a game: ""what is it ? i'm so confused. I think this song is famous, and it's made by ITZY or something..."""
yeji looks like she's ready for a new twilight movie and im living for it
Lia: *looks at Chaeryeong* Chaer: I don’t know what you’re talking about
everyone: chill Lia: * sings at chaeryoung *
Ryujin looking so fiiiiiiine with that outfit
Lia was feeling herself in that katy perry song😭🤚🏾
Omg Lia is a confident queen look how comfortable she is we love that
"Lia is such a personality, she's leading this video."
7:08 are you better with melody or lyrics? Ryujin: Choreo
3:50 Yuna's cuteness overload intensifies
Twice song plays  No one. Yeji: My favorite!!
any ARMY remember 3 years ago love yourself her
The other members: singing More and More by Twice. Lia: dAnCe ThE nIgTh aWaY Lmao
4:57 chaeryeong’s face: “anybody know this? lia? ryujin? anyone? ah save me” pure child
international fans when singing Kpop songs: nananaananananananana itzy when singing Kpop songs: nananannaananana
Ryujin: *breathes* Me: I- I think I’m in love
Lia probably did not take her meds kidding! she was so hyper and i’m not complaining.
i can’t take my eyes off on Yeji
"Itzy when others song came up: ""UUH OHHH I KNOW THIS UHH OH, NANANANANANNANANAN""  itzy when dalla dalla came up: ""uhh i dunno this"" ""uhh im confused"" ""ugh""  😂"
I’m one of those people telling that Chaeryeong is so beautiful 😍
Yeji looks like a rich model here. This girl is so precious
*dalla dalla started playing* Yeji: I don't know this song  Ryujin: I'm so confused  Lia: like this is very famous song Yuna: it's sensational
When the BTS songs came they were enjoying it to fullest  My armidzy heart melted 💜☺
Am I the only one who's captivated by Chaeryoung's looks?
Is no one going to say that Chaeryong was  so pretty in that video shes so attractive there.
"When Lia smiles with the eyes and those cheeks, she looks so cute."
I know everyone's said this already but their English is literally so good.
Chaeryong's skin is camouflaging the white background. 😐💕
Yeji looking a lot like the female version of Hisoka here.
"9:33 Chaeryeong is like ""what's going on"" while the others sing out loud and enjoy hahahaha"
8:02 WE WANT CHAERYEONG THE QUEE OF VOCALS FOR THE NEXT ALBUM
Yeji looks like a daughter of a CEO. She looks so expensiveee
YEJI'S ENGLISH IMPROVED SO MUCH OMG! AND HER LOOK! SHE ATE THIS!!
chaeryoung's skin is wow...it looks the same with the color of the wall
"The fact, they know the english verses in ""boy with luv"" but not the korean parts LMAO"
Lia talking in English is so *SEXY AND ELEGANT*  i am falling in love with her more GOSHH ♡♡
Why do they all gotta be so damn pretty
Lia in the middle wearing the blouse look like she's the principle's daughter with her besties in a party at a school in canada.         Yeah😎
People say their vocals not good NOPE their songs not  their suits Example: lia havana Their voıce tone really different
"8:02 is no one gonna talk about this? 🙌💖 YES, CHAERYOUNG! 💕"
"no one: subtitle: hi we are insane - i'm ..., i'm leah, i'm eugene, i'm cheryl, i'm yina💀"
Ryujin knows almost all the melody. SHE MUST REALLY LOVE MUSIC
ChaeRyeong means perfection and my happiness.
Yuna's reaction when Lia tried to keep her silent 'cause she barely heard the melody. 8:51 something
STANNING ITZY IS ONE THE BEST DECISIONS IN MY LIFE I EVER MADE
yeji with that lipstick and hairstyle is just chef’s kiss ✨
lol lia's smiling face and resting face are so different from each other
No one Literally no one Itzy:Hi we are itzy Subtitles:Hi we are insane Bruh..
*Ok but can we talk about how AMAZING Yeji looks with red lipstick on*
Chaeryeong camouflages herself with the wall
Them talking in English*  Midzys: “ that’s our girls “
7:07 RYUJIN DOING “KILL THIS LOVE” MOVE Ok eye- im not ok. ok?
They're all lowkey English speakers and Lia's English voice is magical!
Yeji is so cute when she said ''no no taylor swift''😍😍
"wait but CHAERYEONG IS LITERALLY GLOWING HERE omg :,)"
Nobody: YEJI’S RED LIPSTICK: HI HOW ARE YA?👀
Lia tried to sing Lisa's rap in ice cream was my favorite part😭
"ryujin: hey guys, i think- i think it's team *flashback to ryujin's wE aRe NoT a tEAm tHiS Is cOmpEtiTioN*"
"Nobody talking about Chaeryong. She was so calm during the whole thing, but still ways cute"
Yeji is so pretty and it's still a crime that she isn't a Visual-
"Lia being a crackhead, while Ryujin with her face expression. ""Don't know her"", and everyone is telling Lia to calm down, too funny with these girls. After that, I guess everyone got LIa's crackhead virus going around, being crackheads."
4:58 - 5:11 OMG look at Chaeryoung such a cutie
Chaeryeong the whole time:🙂😲🤨 😂😂😂
"Yeji is looking so elegant with that lipstick , I'm being gay for her"
"itzy trying to speak in english, i'ts one of the most adorable things in this world xdd ( Lia and Ryujin are so good btw)"
No one: Literally no one: Itzy members pretending like they don’t know their song
"10:24 Yeji spent a lot of time in 2020 (and continues to do so in 2021) learning English. It is so perfect how she is not shy to just blurt out English comments, even if she hasn't yet gotten the pronunciation or cadence down yet. Yeji, you are an inspiration to all of us trying to learn a new language!"
Yeji with that look definitely proves that she's twins with Hyunjin 😂😂😂
Yuna is making my heart flutter she's breathtakingly beautiful.
Chaeryoung's English accent is so perfect!
Lis is so confident when she speaks English.
* you guys normally know the melody or the lyrics more? * me mentally answering: * none of the above*
8:06 why is no one talking about Chaeryeong's high note here omg such a talented queen
10:16 Yeji singing is soooooo nice and cute!
"It's kinda weird when their saying name of older group without ""sunbaenim"" 😂"
So it's proved that everyone mostly hear singled ladies song in Alvin and the chipmunks movie's including me too💜🔮
Chaeryeong saying “thank you so much for watchiiiing” is sooo cutteee😭😭😭
It's really cute when it comes to a bts song they all sing at together happily
YUNAAAAAAAAA she's only 1 year older than me BUT SHE'S SO GORGEOUS and I look like a ugly potato 😂
"Большое спасибо за озвучку! Хочу сказать, что это действительно непростая работа,озвучивать, особенно бантанов, которые постоянно тараторят аххахах. Так плюс ещё и выкладывать сразу практически после выпуска, переводить задания, рецепты( как в прошлом выпуске с готовкой). Действительно хочется поблагодарить тебя за старания, желание этим всем заниматься. К твоему красивому голосу, четко поставленной речи мы все так уже привыкли. Именно твоя озвучка лучше всех, смотрю твои видео с удовольствием, ещё раз большое спасибо тебе! И желаю удачи в дальнейшем 💫"
Я во всех соревнованиях be like  Ожидание:Чонгук Реальность:Шуга
"Другие студии : идите домой, сегодня был тяжёлый день. Студия BigHit : а хрен вам. Выполните 14 заданий и так уж и быть пойдёте домой) Спасибо за озвучку)"
Тэхён: Будьте осторожно со своими галереииии. Тэхён как всегда 🤣🤣🤣🤣 выложил не то фото
"бедные дети, они хотят по скорее закончить все игры, чтобы пойти домой 😂😂 понимаааю"
"*— покажите фото?* *— это как старый компьютер, на котором фото загружается вечно* 🤣🤣блин жиза"
"хочется обнять Юнги, он так настрадался ㅠㅠ"
ТЭХЁН с кудряшками - удар ниже пояса !!!
"Первый раз слышу от Чонгука ""Джин почему ты так хорош""😂😂😂😂 Обычно всё наоборот - ""Чонгук почему ты так хорошо"", ""Чонгук так хорош"" Но всё равно выиграл Чонгук😂❤️"
Чимин: -Хен я сделал это на первым попытке Хосок: -Что?!Кто ты такой🗿 😅😅😅
"*Хоби и Тэ даже в этих мемных футболках, выглядят лучше чем вся моя жизнь*  😂✌🌼"
"Боже, есть что-нибудь, что не идёт Техену? Он превосходен,  как всегда!!!"
Гук: Эти попрыгунчики такие злые....  Весь фанДом: *умер от умиления *
"Ирония в том, что они сами это спланировали 😂😔   Буквально весь эпизод: это возможно?!"
"Все мы немного Шуга в школе на физре 😂😂 хорошо, что я уже закончила школу лоол Какой Юнги активный в этом выпуске, обожааааааю"
"Вывод: Чонгук хорош во всём, что зависит от него, а не от удачи Тэхён хорош во всём, где надо иметь ловкие ручки Шуга слишком много думает Хосок слишком эмоционален для победы Чимин упёрт и последователен. Это ему и помогает Намджун не очень ловкий, но умный Джин слишком много на себя рассчитывает  Спасибо мальчики за то, что придумали эти игры, так мы узнаем о вас мнооого нового😉 Спасибо, Кайл, за озвучку💗💗❤️"
Чимин: Хён я попал с первой попытки!! Хосок:кто ты такой 🗿
Чонгук: бросает карту со 2 раза и попадает Юнги:😲 что я делал все это время😂 какой котик   Юнги: кричит Стафф:Он не злится это крики от того что он прошел😂😂😂да он в этом эпизоде Жжет
"Джин с пинг-понгом: Намджун, займись другим делом, потом возвращайся!  Намджун: но мне больше нечем заняться... Джин: тебе тоже?  и у двоих такой вид безысходности 😁"
"Ахаха, монтажёры: ""Напоминаем, что сегодняшний эпизод придумали сами бтс"" 🤣🤣🤣 (или как там они написали)  Тип чтоб знали, что они добровольно не только подписались на это, но ещё и придумали 🤣"
Этот Ким Тэхен вон там такой красивый и мужественный с этими кудрями...
"Честно,но меня просто вынесло после фразы ""сможет ли Джин вернутся домой ?""🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"Господи, Шуга это отдельный вид искусства"
тэхён правильно говорит нужно быть осторжней с галереей 😂😂👌
Ви и Хоби им так идят эти милые футболки. Люблю вас.❤️❤️
"ЕМАЕ ТЭХЕН НЕ СМОТРИ ТАК НА НАС,ТЫ ХОЧЕШЬ НАШЕЙ СМЕРТИ ДА?!!!!?1:47"
"боже, я не могу с лица тэхёна, когда он проигрывает, он такой малыш, хочется ему просто так уже печать поставить"
"Спасибо за настроение, так хотелось им помочь, Юнги милашка, Хосок солнышко, деловой Гук, Чимин обоятельный, спокойный Тэ, возмущенный Джин, и как всегда разумный RM. Удачи вам ребята"
"Прошло только 5 минут, я смотрю Run BTS с БТС, ахахах 😂"
Была очень смешно 😂😂К же я люблю их Тэхен специальна задержалься чтоб юнги победил
Чимин такой ребёнок 😂 а у Юнги чёрная полоса 😅🖤
"Чонгуки, Чимин такие шустрые выполняют почти все как на автомате, молодцы, а как они прошли под верёвками, просто супер! Только вот эти бутылки, как они подвели их! Что же будет дальше! Чонгук о попрыгунчиках ""какие они злые"", 🤣🤣🤣"
"35:36 Джин: Эй Намджун, я покажу тебе как это делается  *Просирает все шансы спустя минуту 😂 оруу Джин да ты просто мастер 😂"
Моя удача в играх по жизни: ЮНГИ!!! 😂😂😂
"Это как старый компьютер,на котором фото загружается вечно. Жизненная жиза.😂😂😂"
Взгляд Тэхёна это отдельное вид искусства🤤
Крикам Юнги нет конца и края🤣🤣🤣 бедный так вспотел
"Чонгук явно хочет отомстить за тот случай, когда все ушли домой, а он остался один😂 Возвращает статус «победитель по жизни»"
"Кто-то: подожди ты всё зделал? Чонгук: я ухожу,я иду домой!!🙌🙌"
"боже,я не могу,то,как юнги называет хосока «хоба»...🥺🥺😭"
"29:28 Тэ поддался Шугу (потому что случайно  по два стакана.....)это было так мило, добрый такой 😘😘😘😘😘😘"
"Оооо, Тэхёни и его кудряшки😍💜 все такие мимиии, Юнги бедненький, долго не получалось😄"
"Чтмин: я закончил хорошо удачи джин  Тэхен: неудачи, ты можешь бросить мне вызов 😆😆 16:27"
"Аххаах ору 😂😂😂 ""напоминаем, что сегодняшний ран бтс был спланирован самими бтс"""
"Джин:  устал как собака, вспотел, разочаровался. Прошел большинство  заданий: ""Я взволнован, это так весело"" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Тэхён с первой попытки попал 👍в игре бросок попрыгунчика
"Хоби:Я счастливчик😁 оо 7!! Я: эффектно, базара нет👍💅"
"Все, абсолютно все, когда проигрывают: Юнги: 23:09 Хосок: 32:35 Чонгук: 30:16 Чимин: 3:49 Намджун: 14:26 Джин: 5:30 И Тэхен: 12:52, 29:39"
Чимин: ХЁНН Я сделал это за одним попытком Хоби: Чтоо??? Кто ты ТАКОЙЙЙ???  Чимин: ХТО Я🗿  АХАХПХПХПХПХПХПХХПХПХПХАХПХЗПХПХАХХАХАХПХПХПЗПЩПЗХАХАЗПХПХХПХПХПХПХПХАХХАХПХПХПЗПЗПХ
"Вухахахахах на 12:14 , когда Ви и Чонгук играли вместе, там на заднем фоне слышны  ""Айщ "" Юнги😂😂😂"
"Их позы, их мимика😂😂😂😂 то как они реагируют на победу, или наоборот, на проигрыш. Боже, я стэню лучших 😂😂😂"
"Ахкзахкх, мне кажется, они не думали, что этот эпизод будет именно таким. Наверное сами пожалели, что предложили такое😂"
Чонгук может всё
"чонгуки такой милашка здесь ,ладошками хлопает,боже как это мило💕💕💕😍😍"
Божечкиии Кайл вы даже не представляете как я ждала вашу озвучку специально не смотрела с анг субтитрами спасибо🙏🏻🤩
"Стафф Биг-Хит нужно бороться, чтобы найти уродливые фотографии Тэхена)"
"о боже, ребята такие красивые, волосы Тэхена это просто топ.у меня тоже токие кудрявые . Чимин молодец болше так часто не проигривает. Джин не сиди на стале)))  Юнги как всегда милий котик.Намджун осторожно с колоколчиками. Чонгук всегда пабеждает не любет проигривать .Хосок не растраивайся все  будет хорошо!)))) А ещё Fila,Fila,Fila,Fila,Fila,Fila,Fila, одежда великолепная ."
"Ты лучший,твой голос так им подходит и к тому же все семь😃🥰💜"
"Я так хочу,чтобы эти футболки были во всех выпускаах"
Болдею от прически Тэ (ฅ´ω`ฅ)
"Так сложно сдерживать смех, когда втихаря смотришь ночью Run BTS, аж пресс болит:)) Чонгук, Чимин, Юнги :)))  Надо ещё днём пересмотреть это вслух) Спасибо большое за озвучку, Кайл! Обожаю!"
Хосок:как будто я не могу выбраться из этой студии Также хосок:который в этой студии 7 лет 😂😂😂😂😂👍
Ран бтс это как смысл жизни ❤️
"Бозе, что за хаус 😂  Вот, что происходит в здании БигХит, когда там Бантаны))"
"Я думала Чонгук поедет домой, но там его ждали эти несчастные баклажки 😁"
"Мне кажется, в этом эпизоде Юнги не пойдёт домой.. 😂😂😂 Бедняжка..  Спасибо за озвучку.. 😍😘"
Ви и Хоби им так идят эти милые футболки. Люблю вас.❤️❤️
Хосок и Тэ 😿
"Но если честно сказать сегодня не день Шуги 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Милаш, так жалко, сахарок наш 😘😘😘😘😘 не расстраивайся😘😘😘"
"Как я люблю когда они играют,эмоции,возмущения ,радость.Я работала в дет саду 14 лет,даже не все дети так реагируют.🤣🤣💜👍"
"Божечки, какой Хоби счастливый😂😻😻"
"Отныне это мой любимый эпизод. Там все такие милые и смешные. Весь выпуск смеялась. То как они злятся, когда у них что-то не получается. Они такие милые, я не могу)) у меня уже щеки болят от улыбки🥰"
Мне стало жалко Юнги😂😂 На самом интересном месте закончилось😤 *Агрессивно жду следущую часть....*
3:45 ну это же Намджун 😂😂😂😂
"Аххахаха , Чимин , я начну😂 Готово:🗿"

Чимин: Хён я сделал это за одним попытком. Хосок: Что ?! Кто ты такой?! Чимин: Кто я ?!🗿   Пиши в комментариях друзей. Который не любит проигрывать.
Бтс:да отпустите нас пораньше домой! бигхит:ладно но сначала выполните 14 заданий потом можете валить Бтс:🗿
"1:47 Кокетка, знает как понравится!"
"Я ждала!!! Очень-очень ждала 😁 Спасибо за озвучку Кайл 💓  Чимин: -Хён я сделал это за одну попытку! J-hope: -Кто ты такой?!?!  Напоминаем, что сегодняшний Run BTS, был спланирован самими BTS 😂 Просто после этого напоминания, хохотала ещё минут 30 Да-да, мы помним, как они выбирали и голосовали."
Чимин: Хен я сделаю это за одну попыткой  Хосок: Что???? Кто ты такой  Ха-ха-ха-ха оруууу я чуть со смеху не умерла 🤣🤣🤣

"2:24 Джин: Мы сразу перейдем к делу. Я начну с колеса.  А ""наглец"" Тэхен: Я уже решил начать первым! И мне нравиться, что все споры они решают мирно - камень, ножницы, бумага"
"Честно говоря, я понимаю, насколько сильно люблю Бантан, глядя на то, как ребята выполняют тяжёлые (бесячие!) задания, для того, чтобы просто повеселить нас 🥺🙏 Всем АРМИ: I Purple You 💜💜💜 А мальчикам успехов, терпения и сил! 🥰🙏💜💜💜"
Вааааа спасибо большое😁💜💜💜
Сегодня Чонгука повезло😁
"То как Чимин нагло соврал Хоби😂 а он, бедный, все время повторяет, как он сделал это с первой попытки? 😂😂😂😂 не могу с Чимы😂😂"
Эй Хоба 🥺
"Чонгук модет ВСЁ, абсолютно ВСЁ."
Что за счастье 😻❤️
"Кажись,Тэ-Тэ забрал звание Юнги ""самый спокойный котик"".Ну серьезно!Вы видели,как активен Юнги и Спокоен Тэхён.  И всё-таки,то,как Кайл подбирает тон голоса к мемберам и максимально эмоционально их передаёт-неповторимо.    Кайл, спасибо за прекрасные эмоции.Буду надеяться,что ты тоже радуешься нашим комментариям."
"Тэхён: учитесь на своих ошибках. БТС: выбирают 777 в которой чуть коньки не отбросили 🤣💜💜 Кайл, спасибо)"
"Чимин: Я справлюсь. Давай не будем жаловаться не попробовав, Чимин!   Вывод: от них можно везде и всегда получить мотивацию✊"

"Actually, it's one man only he edited that"
"They are not twins , both are same it's magic of camera 📷😂"
Wow this is amazing😆😆😆
"Hearing both 1D's and BTS's song together is just another level ✨✨ Any directioner who likes bts / army who likes one direction , in here"
In the whole video they were figuring out weather it's just one person or he has a twin😂😂😂
He can sing in 30 different voice🤩😁.. React to that vdo too

"ATTENTION CALLING ALL DIRECTIONERS          As you all know, the 11 year anniversary is coming up on the 23rd of next July. But we have some projects we must complete before then. Those targets are as follows;          1) Even though songs like More than this, best song ever, etc, have hundreds of millions of vi3ws,  it's still not what they deserve.  We have decided to str3am the song on July 22nd, the day before the 11 year anniversary to get the song to charts. Maybe we have to start str3aming a little bit beforehand, but still. We need to str3am the song on every possible platform; YouTube, Spotify, iTunes, Amazon music etc. If this is the same group of people who sold FNB stadium within a minute, then why couldn't we be able to do this?          2)  This was planned a year ago, but this time we could easily do this. The second project is to str3am drag me down, which as we can see is so close to 1 billion vi3ws, but, story of my life isn't, so we will str3am story of my life on July 18th (The last Sunday before the anniversary) and make the masterpiece number 1 on that day. I think none of the above are difficult tasks, but that's only if we spread the words. So kindly spread the words.let's do it!!          Copy and paste this, guys, believe me we can do it! I know we kinda planned it last time and fell short, but we can do it if we try harder!!!"
0:12  The tune he’s talking about is of “what makes you beautiful.”  Every directioner can guess it without any second thought.
I'm a army girl in the bangtan world 💜💜
BTS never disappoints to make people proud💜
Army 💜💜💜🤘🤘🤘  From India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳   Lots of Love for Korea 🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷

"Ты тоже пришёл сюда ради BTS? А да кстати, сейчас все песни похожи друг на друга, ведь уже и придумывать нечего, зачем уже устраивать скандал ? Слова и песни все ровно разные!"
"Да. Начало реально похоже на Blood sweat and tears. Не надо трогать песням BTS, они очень популярные,сразу можно раскрыть"
"Короче коментарии забиты бтс, будет большая война, потому что фанатов бтс больше чем у кого либо!"
когда это вас стали волновать бтс. странно
Здесь ради бтс.
"4:44 время кто арми , чтобы было легче 💜"
"Моя Любимая песенка у BTS,  люблю этих мальчиков😘😘😘"
4:37 кому лень искать бантанов) Арми🌟💊🖐️
"меня смущает тот факт что там написано что песня BTS BS&T вышла в 2017,хотя она вышла в 2016"
Blood sweet tears bts украли только хотела слышать этого🗿🗿
Почему я вспомнила пародию Хосока 5:59🤣🤣🤣
Вас послушать все песни  и клипы Ольги Бузовой краденые
Все песни похожи у исполнителей . Всегда так было
"МузТиВи будьте осторожнее на поворотах упоминая Бантан-BTS, Арми не спят и за Вами следят, надеюсь Вы понимаете силу Арми и лучше на себе не испытывайте её. )"
"""Бузова - поп-принцесса Российского шоу-бизнеса"", скажи это кому-нибудь, например  в 2005-м, в дурку бы сдали сказавшего, ей, Богу... 🤦‍♂️😆😏"
Я тоже только ради бтс .
"Я не думаю ,что они будут вспоминать старый песни и делать из них новую"
"Аааа я не успеваю лайкать вас Арми😂💜 Все пршли сюда ради BTS, и я в том числе."
"Да сейчас все пишут одинаковые песни, под копирку - не удивительно. Никакой фантазии, одинаковые биты, басы"
В коммах одни АРМИ😂😂💜💜💜💜💜
"Так, у BTS не крадём, а у других можно брать. Так что мне не важно 🖤🖤"
"Да это давно известно, что вся её звёздность построена на воровстве  у других звёзд, так как этот проект создан на короткое время, чтобы собрать побольше ..."
Ради bts придётся посмотреть.🗿
Можно подумать как будто она сама их пишет!!
"Не, для мня начало у Бузовой и BTS не похоже- Думаю просто совпадение"
"Муз тв, просмотры большинство только из-за БТС😂🥰"
Мне кажется или тут только ARMY собрались как и я)))
АРМИ Я НЕ УСПЕВАЮ ВАС ЛАЙКАТЬ 😂❤️
"Я: просто решила посмотреть коменты  Коменты: ""Всё ради bts"""
"Зашла в комментарии, одни Арми👍😂"
"Уважала Бузову всей душой,но за ВТS упала на дно к креветкам🗿🤙"
Тупо сплагиатила и  не признается:(
Она вообще человек?. Да не один нормальный человек не вёл бы себя так  Низко  чтоб просто прославиться. Я даже не могу подобрать ей слова 😒
С одной стороны да огромное сходство. Но очень сложно сделать что-то новое потомучто очень много артистов
"Вот песня Ханны и Бузовой реально, похожи."
"В стране где Бузова звезда,делать нехуй"
Когда пришла только ради 💜𝗕𝗧𝗦⟭⟬💜
Я вообще пришла смотреть Run BTS 😂
"Конечно, как разговор идёт про к-поп так всего лишь на минуточку, а как например  про развод каких нибудь звёзд так неделю могут показывать😑"
Аааааа. Почему так много комментариев про БТС?!?!?!?!?
"Эта по головам пройдет,не заметит ни родных,ни близких!"
"Я сделала то,что не удавалось сделать никому.Показала все свои трусы с гардероба!!!🤣🤣☝️"
"Я когда впервые услышала ""Привыкаю"" тоже подумала. что Ханна поет. Вокально похоже"
"Олечка,отличные клипы!!!"
"Я тут ради Сердючки, сломаю систему😂❤️"
Вы видели рекламу с Элли Ди? Это же круто!!!
5:15 почему мне он Моргенштерна напомнил?
Когда муз-тв все делают через пробел🗿👍
То чувство когда ты Арми🗿👍❤
ДЛЯ ОТВОДА ГЛАЗ   ОТ СИТУАЦИИ В СТРАНЕ!!
Я прочитал съехали ли вы? 😂
4:49-4:58 они реально похожи
БТССССС УХУ🥺❤️
"С просторов интернета...""Раньше клали слова на музыку,а теперь кладут и на слова и на музыку""😁"
Как Амалия в Туркменистане 🤣 Amalia-yzyna sara Stefflon Don-16 shots
Мадемуазель у вас потрясающий музыкальный слух я скажу
"я одна в песне ""Принимай меня"" услышала начало ""Spring Day"" ?))"
Конец убил вообще 😹😹😹
А еще Агутин поет за Варум🤣
Началась истирия! У музтв !
"5:13 оо,блин,моя любимая русская песня 😄"
я  тоже пришла рады бтс
Боже читаю коментарии все ради БТС сюда пришли😂😄👍🏻
"Начало ""мандаринка"" точная копия начала EXO- call me baby"
Так и представляю картину. Новый год праздничный стол. И все поют танцуй под бусову а не вот кто то с горочки спустился или на тот большак
BTS 💜💜💜🇷🇺💜💜💜💜🇰🇷💜💜💜
Что за бред??? В каждой музыке есть что-то похожее из другой! Ведь существует всего семь нот! И соответственно они могут пересекаться в разных композициях!
Теперь знаю что Оля Фанатка бтс )
Так у первой Насти кудри с кем то рвньше вышел трек нам будет жарко
И эту ворюгу до сих пор не посадили? На весь мир ворует и глазом не моргнет и всё с рук спускают.
"Пиарится,благодаря БТС?! 6:28-СМЕШНО,КОНЕЧНО"
"Объясните кто-нибудь, почему клипы БТС не крутят по муз-тв и по остальным музыкальным каналом России. Авторское право, нужно разрешение?"
А еще у нее лук как у Арианы Гранде)
"Это пзц, а вы в курсе что всего 7 нот? Естесна они повторяются, зачем это всё вообще?"
"Вот про песню мандаринка Ольги Бузовой я соглашусь, по моему года два назад она сама на интервью призналась что слушает bts и хочет записать фит с Чонгуком, но возможно это слухи так что не обращайте внимание, но я точно помню что именно это она и говорила, она сказала что ей больше нравится Чонгук, для неё он краш, и вот и вправду я услышала в самом начале отрывок из песни blood sweat & tears, я даже была в неком шоке......"
"Начало похоже на бтс, но это не плагиат, просто похоже."
Пришла ради бтс 💜
어 보새 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
пришла толко на пару секунд ради  bts
Я только ради бтс зашла
Упоминания в комментариях: Ольга Бузова - 50% БTS - 100%
Я которая люблю и Олю и Бтс😔🙏🏻♥️
4:37 Для Арми
Какое позорише им должно стать стыдно
ВАУ  я не удивлена почему только у BTS типр больше груп нет
Пришла суда ради BTS 💜💜💜
"КТО решил , что она принцесса , да еще и ""певица"" ? Бузиха ?"
Она хоть сама на что нибудь способна?
"Всего 7 нот, конечно все песни будут похожи друг на друга. И песни и музыку ей пишут авторы."
La unica army latina ❤
Захожу в кометы и вижу только коментарии про BTS
Нот всего семь могут быть и совпадения 😄
Арми:шо  маза фак!?🗿😑
Эти несколько секунд про бтс ?
Çox gözəl

hi lovely ARMY 💜
i love how this was 96% just jin eating
Let's be real Jin is the funniest member on vlive he is just a gem
Jin- Oh Im in the USA Jin- WhO ArE YoU?! *Im deaddd
I love that Jin literally just eats when he is on vlive it cracks me up
"Jimin: ""We can't drink on vlive""  Meanwhile Jungkook: Drinks a bunch of wine and eats a night apple is posion apple B)"
jin whenever he eats: *mmm mmm bery bery deliciousu*
"8:29, jins laugh cracks me up every time😂😭"
JM: How did you enter college  Jin: With my handsome face
No one : LITTERALY no one: Suga: re thinking his life decisions 1:37
"3 types of friends   Hobi =scared   Jungkook=saying he's not scared but he is   Suga =there nothing ,you don't have to worry about it"
Jin: *fake cries* RM: “What was that noise?” Jin 👁👄👁
"Jimin : ""we can't do that , Young Army's are Watching us ""  This  Man is really a Angel 😭"
"Jin: I'm not drinking, I'm DiSiNfEcTiNg My ThRoAt. Me: *dies of excessive laughter*"
RM: Chilling  Jin :Eating  Suga: Sleeping  J-hope: smiling at a random gurl  Tae Tae : Dead  Jungkook: lying  Oh wait...  Jimin: how DiD u GeT iN tHe CoLlEgE????
Jungkook: there’s nothing behind me. I’m not scared of ghosts Also jungkook: *looks behind him a million times while removing everything behind him*
“i’m the cutie” ICONIC.
"""wHo ArE yOu?"" LMAO I CAN'T EVEN-"
My favorite part : Jin:Mmm mmmh bery bery deliciouseu  😂
Jin : I don't follow what the agency says
0:42 hobi sounds like he’s running for president or something
i like how if someone else interrupts the frozen screen thing everyones so pissed but if it's yoongi no one says anything
14:12 this is sadly the closest thing we have to a live performance of telepathy
1:37 suga kills me 😂😂
Mom- Do not drink anything while you eat. Me- *nope* Jimin- I do not drink anything while I eat. Me- I will do that too UwU.
no one: jhope: picture behind me is moving?💀
no one: jin:  oh wait... im in the US                 wHo ArE yOu?!
I wish I had a group of friends that I had this type of relationship with. They're so hilarious and I doubt they get bored very often as one of them is always cracking up the others. Not to mention their love for each other is a beautiful thing to see. 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"Jin:I’m worldwide handsome, *wink*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Jin:hurry up clap! *Makes eye contact with the mebers*.                                                                                                                                                                                        Everyone: *nervously claps*"
Jin:*Laughing*  Also Jin*sounds like he is dieing*
"the title should be ""try not to have a lung failure for 16 minutes straight"""
To everyone who doesn't know The jin and jimin : part That's what boys do when the hangout *eat eat eat *
11:48 jk trying to act cute to get them to stop 😂
FAM 9:52 HAD ME LAUGHING SO HARD MY FAMILY THOUGHT I WAS POSSESSED🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭
reasons to love Jin... his weird but cute laugh his winks  his laughing\eating ability his mouth movements  his seriousness his whining  his lying  his music!
jin doing his eatjin show with jimin is the best i laughed so hard
1:39 In this compilation Yoongi is practicing how to be a stone.🗿🗿
I can't even with jin's : WhO aRe YoU & what'seu happenedeu ?  😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆
1:51 the crewlest moment for Jin because he can't control him from taking the food
"9:43 me getting ready to eat at the mall, 9:50: sitting in the car, suddenly mom says u can't eat there ur reaction 9:53"
8:06 when jimin said that young army is watching us so they can't drink infront of them- that was so thoughtful and mature of them💜✨
10:00 I love how distressed Jungkook looks while also loving Jin's reaction.
"we all know when Jin is eating his noodles and “crying”, then rm coming in is probably the most iconic scene EVER"
1:31 J-hope is just the extra that you never knew you needed
"Jin : You want coke or sprite? Jimin : I don't drink. Jin : What? Jimin: I don't drink  while eating. Jin : You don't deserve to be in this room. Jimin : Give me sprite, bro!   LMAO jimin-"
1:05 Jin's kids would call him World wide handsome before even calling him father
Jin: I don't follow what the agency says. Me: I dont follow what my mom says. My mom: 👹👹👹
Jimin at 1:28: Its really embarrassing  Meanwhile hobi at 1:30: 🥳🥳🥳
"""i don't follow what the agency says.""                                         -- Jin World Wide Handsome, VLive"
"I miss eat jin  Actually, I just miss Jin in general"
No one:  Not even expensive girl:    Jhope:  *I was trying to hold my breath*
I love Jin's humor. He makes me laugh everytime that's why he is my bias XD
Taehyung and jimin couldn't care less in when Jin's like WhErES jUnGkOOk?¿!
But really YOONGIS  the only one who can stay still smh
No one Literally no one Hobi at the beginning: WaSSSUPpPP
jimin and jin eating is so funny jin should make a youtube channel of him just eating
nobody: jin eating: YUMMMMMMMMM
My mum: eats Me: CaN i HaVe A bItE? Also u gotta admit that jimin and Jin and namjoon and junkook and yoongi and j-hope and v are the cutest things ever
"0:36 I like how namjoon is like “I’m *the* cutie. point, blank, period.”"
Jin is actually the only person that I know that looks good even if he's just eating----
"Haters  are  planning  to  send  THOUSANDS  of  hate  comments  to  hobi  telling  him  to  k*1ll  himself  on  his  birthday.  I've  seen  many  tweets  on  Twitter  of  their  plan.  This  could  damage  his  mental  health.  I'm  begging  you  to  share  this  to  TikTok,  Instagram,  or  even  group  chats.  It  doesn't  matter  just  please  spread  this  around. #protecthobi"
sooo no one gonna talk about the fact that jin wore a 990 dollars hoddie that just says “It’s my birthday and all I got was this overpriced hoodie” LMAOOOO
“Oh wait I’m in the U.S. who are you?” BRO THAT HAD ME DYING
Jimin and jin eating is ALL I NEED TO STAY ALIVE PERIOD
"Jin: Jimin, you may not know but I graduated from a college. Jimin: How did you enter a college? Jin: *Dies*"
Jimin...don't act surprised...you're always coughing up sunshine and love
Jungkook: please say something whats moving I'll take it out  Imagine armies saying: The hotel is moving                             Then how is Jk gonna take the hotel out XD
Me watching Jin eating be like: I’m HuNgRy
"the first time all of them were trying to stay really still , the only one who managed to be COMPLETELY still is jimin😂. which is so ironic"
"when v said ""I'm not done yet"" with a dead straight face and jin was so mad  I dIED"
Jin's thought process is an absolute genius 8:20 Mr. world wide handsome is going places
i’m really about to become an army watching these videos💀
Jin: oH bErY bErY DeLiCiOuSeU HAHAAH
petition for jin to start a mukbang channel 💜 😌
"10:10 jin's the oldest but when RM opened the door he was like ""oh shit...."""
Nobody:  Jin winking while eating 😂❤️
the way Jimin wanted sprite... hobi: why
*eat Jin is a literal TV show at this point*
No matter how much of a huge army am i jin at 3:40 HAD ME SCREAMING
"Army: There's someone behind you J-Hope: PANICS Suga: ""You must be a foreigner. There's no one behind me, I'm not turn around. That's not funny"""
jin really didn't know what words to use for describe what he was eating 3:15
I just want a husband like J-Hope and I promise I won't ask for anything
Jimin loves bring in everyone’s v live. He makes an excuse like the good one is a great example. Then he sits down and joins. 😂😂😂😂❤️🥺
ngm:  ngm mesmo:  jhope: whatsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaapp
“BERY BERY DELIOUSUE” - Jin (what an inspirational quote 🥰)
4:05 - Jin's laugh .. *It's different.*
"If other member interrupt their ""frozen screen"" : HDHDJDJEHDJEVEJSVSH! If Yoongi interrupts their ""frozen screen"" : Why are we doing this?"
I love how 90%jin and85%jimin.I love how jimin is always in other members vlive lol
Jin is the one who eats much but doesn´t gain any weight lol      thx for the likes
everyone: i’m cutie uwuu hoseok: HOPE👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 J HOPE😃👍🏻👍🏻
Jin always has crackhead energy when he eats 😂😭😭😭
"I CAN'T JIN REALLY SAID "" Wait im in the US... WHO IS IT?!"" NOOO IM DEAD"
Mom: food? Me: Jinnie 💜
Jin's face is so squishy when he's eating 🥺🥺
No one Literally No one... Jin: I don't eat spicy food.. because I have some side effects in toilet next morning! ( I'm cracking my head )
Fun fact: RM was actually cute when he said he is the cutie
jin and jimins frienship is so cute omg
Jin is the Ultimate Mukbanger!
BTS introducing themselves Everyone: embarrases to spin around Jhope: Dancing in a spin and loving himself and having so much fun😂 This is why I love his so much
I died when it said “go all to hell” 💀
Esra is looking very beautiful in Pakistani clothes♥️.

"Thats why namjoon is the leader, he holds everyone together"
"Namjoon is simply an amazing leader, without him BTS could not exist. 💜💜"
Thats why namjoon is the leader.He holds everyone together .   We love you namjoon .  We're 🇮🇳🇮🇳  INDIAN ARMY 🇮🇳🇮🇳.
This proofs that BTS can't exist without Namjoon 💜😭
"Let’s be honest Namjoon one of the best leaders I have ever meet he brings BTS together, he respects them, he cares for them, he taught ARMY’s how to love themselves. BTS and ARMY are so luck to have him. 💜🥺"
Namjoon nació para esto hasta su nombre lo dice
***THIS LITERALLY PROVES THAT THERE IS NO BANGTAN WITHOUT NAMJOON***  😭😭😭😭💜💜💜💜💜💜
Song: We Are Bulletprrof The Eternal
He’s the leader and he holds everyone together as a family 😭💜
This proofs that indeed NAMJOON is the foundation of BTS. He started it. He's our great leader.
Me: there is no army😕😕           Meanwhile jungkook knuckles be like: am I a joke to u🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😘💜💜💜
He's the leader and he holds everyone together as a family 😭💜💜
*BTS isn't complete without our Rap monster.Purple you Armys💜*
Namjoon es un dios supremo
To all the Namjoon haters out there: this proves that Bangtan is not complete without him (or any member in general)
Namjoon herseyi tamamlıyor
WoW namjoon ya estaba destinado a ser nuestro perfecto lider
OMG...I didn't think about it before...our leader is the root of everyone ...I love him and other 6 flowers....I am literally crying while writing this ...
Quando que o Namjoon ia saber que o nome dele teria aver com o futuro dele ❤❤❤❤❤
The fact Namjoon holds them is heart warming for ARMY’s 😭💜😚
"J U C  D        S N H O    J  O H A N B I   N O N G O N G E W H B H Y     O Y B W U     O U Y A N         K    N H                    Y                    E                    O                    N                    G Hanbin, without you, iKON will fall apart. It will be Jnhwan, Sog Yun hyeong, Obby, Dog Hyuk, Jun Oe and Chwoo. iKON will never be the same.😭"
Proves that NAMJOON is the real leader and without him BTS won't exist 😭😭💜💜💜 Eomma I'm secretly famous 🙀🙀🙀. Today I changed my notification settings and I'm jUnGsHoOk I got 1.6k likes
"when Bang PD said he'd built a group around Namjoon, this came literally huh"
I love bts and i will never stop i was crying of joy when someone else also figured it out tysm for this video ❤️
Namjoon is the best leader in this world. He is the best. The most cutest leader in the world I have ever seen. Namjoon the legend. He taught me to love myself. We armies and bts are lucky to have a leader like this. I love u namjoonie oppa.🥺🥺😭😘💜❤
He isn't the leader who holds the group for nothing 💜
Namjoon is the root of his group. So he is the root of their name and their life. Namjoon recieves hate but Is the best leader rapper and dancer.
I think namjoon is the best leader I have ever seen. He takes care of everyone and respect everyone.  He he so peaceful and calm. HATS OFF TO NAMJOON! BORAHE BTS!!!!!💜💜💜💜💜🙏
I cant say ARMY without RM
"He is not being "" you can't say ARMY without RM""  for nothing. He also being the "" you can't say BANGTAN without Namjoon """
That’s Why He’s The Leader He Holds Everybody in the Groups’s Name This is So Cute 🥺🥺 He’s The Best Leader Ever 🥺🥺
Namjoon is the leader and this is the proof
"everyone: using namjoons name to spell out the other members me, an intellectual: JJB, UTIYHA, GEIIOSG, KHNNNET, OYGOA, OUIKN,  KN, G."
"Omg this is amazing Namjoon is a true leader , he holds all of them FAMILY ❤️💕"
Dude this is amazing. Yup without namjoon nothing would have been possible 😔 😌
Namjoon is the father of them how not to train them and without the bts it would be nothing
Friend: how United bts are? Me: even they name can be joined together
"Notice that ""Namjoon"" has 7 letters and holds together all the members names? Thats a true leader💜"
"Namjoon is the center I'm convinced , I've been convinced for 5 years, there is no way your telling me I can not be convinced I'm done"
He is the whole bangtan world
"La otra vez hice algo parecido solo que enves de empezar con ""NamJoon"" Lo hice con ""ARMY"" uwu"
"NAMJOON is the best leader and that's why is ""THE LEADER"""
This proves Namjoon is dad for real 😂😂😂
This proves Namjoon is dad for real 😂😂😂
This shows namjoon is the best leader they are even connected through namjoons name they are nothing without each other love u BTS forever 💜💜💜💜
the fact that it starts from the leader 😭❤💜 also why do all ARMYs put the member's full first name apart from jin's lol I never see seokjin 😂😂😂😂
He was destined to be BTS's leader 💜🥺
When the bang pd asked namjoon that he wants bangtang together or want to go solo so without any hesitation he said bangtang 😭love you namjoon you're the best leader ever😊💜💜💜💜
Namjoon is the glue he is the leader so this makes sense
Quisiera que los cuadernos vinieran con una portada así :3
And this is why Namjoon is the leader  He holds everything
Bang si hyuk + yeontan = bangtan 😒😒💜💜💜💜 its the reality 😂😂😂
"Once in a V live an army said THANK YOU FOR BEING SUCH A GOOD LEADER, then Namjoon replied - I am not the one who is great it is the members who have made me feel great. 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
this proves namjoon is the leader and they are just them
Namjoon holds Bangtan together...this has me in tears
"NAMJOON IS EVERYTHING FOR OUR BANGTAN , BANGTAN IS NOT COMPLETED WITHOUT ANY MEMBERS 😭"
"Namjoon, a good leader unites Not divides. We will pray that Namjoon will be given the wisdom to Keep the group united for good. Keep it up RM. We love you!"
Without Namjoon everything is incomplete 🥰
Namjoon+BTS+Army = Family and Love 💜💜💜
That's why he is the leader.
OUR LEADER IS THE BEST LEADER WHICH I HAVE  NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE . AND NEVER WILL SEE THE LEADER LIKE NAMJOON . THEIR IS NO ONE LIKE OUR LEADER KIM NAMJOON. I PURPLE U . 💜💜💜
"Other people: Fate brought the 7 of them together Still other people: Bang shihyuk brought the bangtan boys together. But for me, Namjoon brought them all together."
Ouhhhh namjoon is the best leader
this is why namjoon is the rightful leader
More like Without Namjoon there's no Bangtan💜💜
I was clapping for Namjoon throughout the video 🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 Namjoon is my  idol
This proves that BTS cannot be 'BTS' without Namjoonie 🥺💜
Namjoon is the pillar.. No one can change that
THAT'S Y HE IS THE LEADER OF BANGTAN 🥰🥰
El secreto oscuro de Namjoon
me bopping my head to this song
"Also, we cannot spell ARMY without RM"
The Struggel with Hoseoks name xD i felt that
It all started with him 😊
Namjoon his 6 naughty cute babies ❤️❤️
You know what does this mean???? There will be no one BTS without namjoon❤️ Precious😭
"and you can't spell ARMY without RM, so there's literally no reason to hate this man😔💜✨"
"Namjoon is a great leader no matter how much he broke everything, this group he build is unbreakable. 💜"
That's why he is leader  Because they are all in him 💜💜💜😘😘
theres a reason why is namjoon be the leader
A leader never dies it holds back its tears for the crew just like namjoon 😢💜💜
World's best leader: Kim namjoon....💜💜😊
Namjoon holds the Bangtan.... but in his name also🤧🤧😭😭👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
It means because of namjoon we have our precious talented KINGS BTS
That's why rm is the leader becoz all the names r join with him .
"You cant speel army withouth rm you can speel others name withouth namjoon,namjoon is our leader untill the end"
Hahaha love that you took everyone’s real names except Seokjin’s
Namjoon is there sun(besides hobi)that keeps them together  The song made me cry😭😭😭💜💜💜
Namjoon hold everyone in his name is any other groups can do that
The beginning where Jin's speech and Jimin's voice overlaps makes me so emotional
Many people forget that there will be no Bangtan without Namjoon. He receives so much hate. He deserves the whole universe. He has suffered a lot but still he never gave up. He never let his weakness take over him. He chose Bangtan over solo. He is the best leader.
That's why he is the leader of BTS ! That's why they own our world pride of BTS 💜 the person who holds everything in him is really a great person 😢💜
Let's be honest... I never think in this way girl thank you so much you show me something I really appreciate....  Just thank you thank you so much... 💜💜 You nice girl keep going 😉💜💜 BTS FOREVER 💜
Is no one gonna talk about her handwriting!!! IT'S BEAUTIFUL💜
So thats why namjoon is the leader💜💜
"BTS is incomplete without our leader, worldwide handsome, sunshine, kitty, mochi, boxy smile, or kookie. 1-7=0 💜"
What a beautiful name namjoon have 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Namjoon is the piller.
"Kids watching : _ _*_""Tom & Jerry""_*_ _ Army's watching : _ _*_""Jin & Jungkook""_*_ _  _ _*_They are a Tom & Jerry Army's literally all time fighting_*_ _ 😂😅"
Jungkook is the golden Naughty maknae so he will do everything
_ _*_Jungkook : Im the oldest in BTS_*_ _  _ _*_5 minutes later :_*_ _  _ _*_Jungkook: iM sTiLl YoUnG sO....._*_ _
**BTS are billionaires**  Meanwhile: Suga: who need more money? Jungkook: Me!!!
*J*- Joyful *U*- Unique *N*- Nice *G*- Genius *K*- King *O*- Outstanding *O*- Open-hearted *K*- Kind
_ _*_Random person: someone can’t steal your heart twice_*_ _   _ _*_Jungkook: Hold my Bunny Smile_*_ _
I still can't get over the fact that he dropped his phone while chasing Tae
Jk first target is jin 😂 and second jimin 😂🤣🤣
"_ _*_Honestly, everything Jungkook biased is really lucky. No, the world is fortunate for the existence of_*_ _  _ _*_"" Jeon Jungkook ""_*_ _"
*JK hurts V.* *V gets mad and starts cry* *Jin hugs V* *JK feels bad* *V not forgiving*
"Jk's targets are jin ,jimin ,v 😂😂😂"
Jin and Jungkook = Father and Son .
Jungkook is the maknae so he has to be naughty 😂🤣💜
This is literally hyungs trying to fight with jungkook..
Jinkook in most of the moment
Jungkook: I am not baby   Few moments later : acts like baby  Anyway he is the cute baby makae in BTS
"It's funny how he doesn't do that with Hope, Yoongi and Namjoon, but fights a lot with Jin, the eldest 😅 Jin must be a really cool guy"
Let's be honest; it's mostly just JK fighting Jin and the maknae line. 😆 He rarely tries to mess with RM or Yoongi.
Suga: Who needs more money?  Jungkook: ME!! Also Jungkook: I need it to beat Jin hyung!
"Jungkook : target locked its definitely ""jimin"" Jimin : dashi run run run"
Suga: who need more money  Jungkook: ME 👀 (Same jungkook same💀😂🤚)
"WHAT I LEARNT  : YOU TRY TO FIGHT KOOKIE,                                   YOU ARE DONE FOR"
"ARMY: HEY Kookie this is kinda, sorta considered abuse and we know it's fun bu-  Jungkook: *Shhhhhhh* it's ✨brotherly love✨"
"I love how they reacted when they accidentally hit that girl it was so nice and they didn't just say sorry, now that is what I like to call pure/kind people."
"Alternative title:  Jungkook trying to fight Jin, Jimin and V"
Jungkook is big now but his mind is still a baby 😁😁
Did you guys notice that its the hyungs who started first then he fight them back ?
"Jungkook is bangtan baby,also army baby"
Our Kookie likes to tease and fight with everyone 💜
He's gonna accidentally kill Jin someday😂
*jungkook hits jin* Yoongi: who needs more money! Jungkook: *stop everything* mE
Who that dislikers for this cute video why they are seeing and they are putting unlike 🙄 eppadi avangalukku eda dislike panna masu varudo theriyala🤦. This video is so so cute 🥰😘😍
Jungkook is so adorable and so handsome young man to BTS 💜💜
JK is literally me when my friends do that with me hehe
Seeing this makes me wonder....🤔       HOW THE HELL ARE THEY STILL IN ONE PIECE🤣🤣🤣
90% R jin N JK
RM be like that they said being a leader would be fun at 9:04
It should be everyone trying to fight jungkook literally and then jungkook fighting them back strong😂
"JK is such a playful person! He loves to pat others on the butt, especially Tae and Jin!"
"Ahh please rename title of video. It should be""jungkook fighting to jin"" 😂"
"9:50 hah golden times🙂, I miss this😔"
"_ _*_Jungkook Google history Golden Maknae good at everything :_*_ _    _ _*_""How be fighting everyone's""_*_ _"
When jungkook ran because taetae hit him with a ball  Me;Q-Q BOI THE PHONE.THE PHONE ITS- I CAN’T ;——————;
It's Jin who is the biggest victim of our naughty maknae
Junk kook us a very naughty and cutie boy💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜love u jk
Jin never considered jk as human and sem goes for jk. And that's best thing 😂
BTS : Kookie is a baby ... Jk : Hold my carrots 💜💜
More like Jungkook trying to fight everyone...            Except Yoongi
LOVE YOU BANGTAN  ARMY FOR EVER  IM KOOKIE STAN🐰💜 WHERE ARE YOU ARAB ARMY😭💜.!  الارمى العرب اسبتو وجودكوو! 🇪🇬ناعع من مصر ☺💜
someone: no one can look cute while fighting someone  kook: Hold ma banana milk!
Jimin has mad patience 😂
Jin was just playing around in the sand N jungkook was just chilling by the van when he just decided to go n trouble jin LMAO 😂😂😂😂😂
1:20.....did anyone see kookie got so mad that he even threw away his mobile phone just to chase Tae😅😂💜
Jk punching jimins back or butt: JM standing still then starts dancing: Jk still hitting:     Lol
LMAO JUNGKOOK ALWAYS GOING FOR JIMIN BC HE THE SMALLEST-
mostly I see was how jin was bullied by kookie....😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow @ jungkook you are always trying to fight well guess what I fight I'm almost good at anything I can play the cello and dance and sing we are just alike #luv you bts and jungkook 😀😀😀😀💖💖💖
So 90% of this is Jimin and Jin! 🤣🤣🤣 such brotherly love
Fighting especially Jin Jimin and V
0:39 they are silent because namjin are sleeping
Jungkook always wants to fight Jin and the rest of the maknae line🤣
"Ahem how isn't anyone talking about how Tae said ""How dare you hit my hus...I almost said Husband"""
I was literally laughing at 0:52 how jungkook was fighting and jin was stopping him
"They are paying  snow ball,,  🌨️🌬️❄️❄️❄️BTS❄️❄️❄️"
"ahh i'm the 12 comment, it's like 4AM and I have school, but I choose not to sleep, stay up and watch our Jungkookie prince charming pretty but evil little vicious maknae, my oppa saranghae"
"Actually Jungkook is the nicest , polite, considerate and bestest boy^^"
after watching so many times the clip of v kicking ball on to jk when jk was running his phone fell down i realized just now
JUNGKOOK So Cute and Naughty boy......💜 so funny💜 Who love JUNGKOOK?💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Amazing how kookie is the goodest and the maknae of the team yet he has learnt to express his love by roughhousing with his hyungs  It shows how much leeway his hyungs have given him and thats so cute
10:08 i guess that fan is dying inside why? Because taetae called her as his wifie tf hope all🙂🥲
Fact 1 Jk youngest member Fact 2 Jk is not aware of any member
jin : i have small gift for you jerry jk: i have bigger than your gift tom
1:25 jk even drop his phone😂😂just to catch v
It's more like Jin and junkook fighting 😂🤣😹😹🤣😂😂🤣😹😹🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂
"They are so patient with each other, if I were to live with my friends for 7 or so years , a few of them would have been dead by now"
how on hell is this man so perfect
JK is younger member in BTS he is our little baby so he do everything
Friends: You like bts cuz they are handsome and popular  Meanwhile the real reason is:
ot6: [lightly nudge jk] jungkook: so you have chosen...*DEATH* 👹
I wish i had a friend like any bts member they are so lucky
This video should be named ‘Just jungkook hitting his hyungs ‘  Am not good at naming I just - Eh 😂
"In Kook's defence, he never starts the fight...he only plays alonge with others"
Did v just call that girl his wife...wOw
At 4.46 . I was enjoying my bedtime green tea ... suddenly spit on my bed due to the sudden big accident of J-Hope .. 😑😑😑😫😫😭😭 😅😅😄😂
1:19 and taetae was never seen again 😞
Thank is one of the many reasons why Jungkookie is my Bias 😊💜💜💜💜
When jungkook went to v to fight with him for throwing ball he dropped his phone 📱
1:00 tae is still adorable when he cried🥺
Poor RM. He looks like a harrassed exasperated father who is this close to giving up. 😂😂
1:24 R.I.P Jungkook's phone 👁👄👁
1:22 Jungkook: Idc if my phone fell and prolly cracked I just gotta beat the shit out of him
"PLEASE , AT 8:01 JIN 😂😂😂 IF I WAS HIM , IMMA BE SOO ANNOYED"
1:23 oh no his phone😂😂
He will do everything to win. Because he is JK✨✨✨✨
Jungkook is hilarious on another level.
3:43 When they forgot that they are world famous musician band!!!!😂😂🤣🤣
Poor Jin usually the recipient of the naughty boy jk's overzealous love...blahaha
I think that jungkook is always a kid not grown up yet😐. And want to mess everything with his hyung😳😳😳 and he is cute and handsome😘😘😘
jimin's laughing sound is heavenly
1:01 this is so sweet 💕💜
"JIMIN is not trying to be perfect, perfect is trying to be JIMIN"

"Jimin's voice  ""New Beginning At Fila"" 😍😍😍😍😍😍🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧💜💜💜💜💜💜🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆"
cuando jimin dijo fila ya sabemos como el aba en español por q en Latinoamérica se dice fila igual entonces así sonaría la vos de el en español
Yet more proof...Park Jimin is literally an angel.

Why am I smiling so much?? Oh right it's Jimin's fault... Again!!!

"THE WAY JIMIN SAID ""FILA"" JGYSNFUWJGTSJFJ 😭"
OMG !! EVERYTHING ABOUT JIMIN IS CUTE 😭😭😭💜
Park jimin....He's very handsome ....my heart :(
Him saying fila is the most cutest thing
latam: como que carbon??  mochi beautiful
This is nothing. Just jimin's overloaded cuteness.
No one :Jimin fila  Army and me :Jimin looks great when he talks English
The way he says Fila at the end is adorable 🥰
We love you jimin ?😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘

Brand Emperor Jimin is FILA's shining endorsement. ✨
TE AMO PARK JIMIN  I LOVE YOU PARK JIMIN
i ain’t getting this just bc i know i will never look as good in this as jimin does...jimin literally owns every piece he wears
"Charlie’s “I got to go, we gotta go” and his facial expressions is everythingggg 😂😂😂😂"
jer and charlie saying “TWINS” was comedic gold they should’ve kept that innnn.
Anyone: Them: let's all wear black without telling Owen
charlie’s “i gotta go!” at the end lmao
oh man I wish they'd kept in the dancer stealing owen's hat
We need Unsaid Emily's behind-the-scenes😭
I CANT KEEP MY EYES OFF OF OWEN DANCING oh my god
0:50 Jer kicking the chair making Charlie kinda trip over it is so hilarious to me 😂😂😂
Why is no one talking about when one the guys dancing with Owen takes his hat? That was so cute and smooth!! Edit: time stamp 4:02 (ish)
owen just got yeeted out of there lmao
i wish the twins part was included in the show !!!
Choreography is incredible all these people are so talented. And Charlies 'WE GoTTA gO' at the end is hilarious ahahahhaa
Medison Reyes Jeremi Shada  Charlie Gillepsie and Owen Patrick Joyner its Legendary people AND AMAZING!
"“TWINS!!” I love everything about this video, the energy levels are through the roof!!"
"""I gotta go, I GOTTA GO, WE GOTTA GO"""
"I feel bad for Owen. No-one told him they were gonna be wearing all black. .... People here waiting for weeks. Me: Ughhhh. 14 minutes? Now I'm really dead. (The content is much appreciated, Mr Becker.)"
"The way Charlie screamed "" I GOTTA GO! WE GOTTA GOOO!"" HAHAHAHA I WISH THEY KEPT IT"
Poor Jermey almost dying from the chair. 😂
NO ONE'S TALKING ABOUT THE HAT THING WITH OWEN??? It's so cute
Charlie looks so concentrated 😂
"Are we getting any unsaid Emily behind the scenes, Paul? I want to watch Charlie pour his heart and soul into it!!!!"
I love the “TWINS” HAHHAHA
Ahaha jer smiling straight at the camera is why I clicked 😂
“we gotta go!” “we gotta go we gotta gooo!”
1:07 the way owen just got lifted killed me
1:06 charlie’s shimmy oml
"""TwInS"" HAHAHAHAHHAH IM DEAD"
owen singing alone in the begging is the actual sweetest thing
owen part is so good! i wish that whole dance sequence was included in the show
I LOST IT BY “TWINS” OMG HAHHAHAHHA
And another episode of let's all wear black and not tell Owen. But seriously this choreography is absolutely stunning 🤯😍
no one: literally no one: Owen: WOW!!!!! Also Owen: I just wanna dance paul!
4:19 me when the band will be on tour
I believe in “Charlie and Jeremy’s hair in this video” supremacy
"THAT SHOULD'VE LEFT THAT ""TWINS!"" IN-"
i’m CRYING this is so fun and the guys are so funny like- “TWINS!” oh my godddd i’m laughing so much this is great
"Charlie at the end ""WE GOTTA GO, WE GOTTA GO"" 🤣"
2:06 this is just so funny i can't 😂
I didn’t even recognize Charlie at first lol
3:14 i was literally watching with my mouth open so amazing wowww
Charlie's facial expressions are always on point hahah
This is definitely one of my favourite BTS videos. So fun and energetic! Love seeing the boys dancing 😁😍❤
WHEN FUEGO PUTS OWENS HAT ON OMG BRILLIANT
3 things: 1) I believe in “Charlie and Jeremy’s hair in this video” supremacy  2) the costumes and editing in the show is so gorgeous but it also kinda distracts from just HOW good the choreography is so I LOVE seeing the rehearsals 3) Owen’s hat being taken off made me 🥺 and idk why
Owen snapped so hard on this like he woke up and chose murder
something about Owen dancing is so freaking attractive like HUH also i love how Jer and Charlie said “twins!” in sync lmao also Charlie’s “ayo i gotta go! we gotta go!” was so freaking cute ANYWAYS i love this entire video
oh my gosh that “TWINS!” line is so cute!!
"I was in a bad mood all day but this made me smile, thanks for this."
"""where's willie?"" Lmao"
"Can't wait for this video, is going to be EPIC and hilarious. I'm living for this!"
i love how charlie puts his arm around owen and jer when it says brotherhood
the serotonin that ran through my veins when they said “TWINS!” im gonna scream-
the fact that jeremy is in character the WHOLE time! we stan
"I love Charlie's expression when the girl is dancing on Jeremy, he's just like ""oh wow..."""
"the trust that all the dancers have in each other, howli woww"
AHH CANT WAIT!
I'm here for the ✨Jeremy Supremacy ✨
1:09 lmao he FLEW❤️😭💀🤚
NOT ME SEEING OWEN DISAPPEAR FROM THE CORNER OF MY EYE-
So Luke were supposed to flirt with the twin! 🔥
this channel one of the only things keeping the fandom fed omfg
"My favourite so far, THANK YOU PAUL, TRULY."
Can we just talk about how in sync the dancers were
the way charlie says i gotta go at the end sdjhslskdls
we need an episode like i got the music but its all the phantoms dancing and julie popping off w her voice
"Okay but seriously, Charlie’s got some moves! His flow is very natural"
I already love this thumbnail ahh this is gonna be so good😂❤️
0:11 I taught charlie was going to fall lmao
"Every time I watch this dance, I have to think about part at 2:35 when they move like they are forced to do it/literally dragged (by Caleb owning them) and then the whole dance hits different. They have to perform even if they don´t want to. Is it just me?"
"Why can't I stop staring at Charlie's hair, especially his headband?"
"Hahaha at the end when Charlie says “OH I GOTTA GO, I GOTTA GO, WE GOTTA GO!!!” To the twins and the boys bahahaha"
"Charlie's ""we got to go"" is some thing i feel like i would say it was so cute. i love charlie omg"
This choreography and these dancers will NEVER fail to amaze me😍 I love seeing the rehearsal process for the dance scenes.
"THIS IS AMAZING!!! I LOVE THIS SO MUCH, EVERYONE DANCES PERFECT AND THE BOYS AND EVERYONE ELSE DID SO SO WELL!!!😳👏👏👏"
IF THIS WAS A SONG THAT WASNT IN THE FIRST SEASON THAT WOULD MEAN THEYRE MAKING SEASON 2 BUT ITS THE OTHER SIDE FROM HOLLYWOOD OMGG I WANT A NEW SEASON SO BADD
everyone is so talented
I wanna see a full on musical production now.
Jer and Char dancing with the twins is AMAZING!!
I really wish that they would she kept the ✨TWINS✨ part in the show😂🥰
I AM LITERALLY IN LOVE WITH THIS CHOREOGRAPHY ❤
1:02 the fake faint is sooo good tho 😌
I think Charlie liked dancing with the twins a lot😂
I can't stop laughing at the WE GOTTA GOOO
it’s really nice to see how hard they had to work and giving us an incredible show
literally two days ago I thought that it would be amazing to see how they rehearsed this dance scene with the boys. and here goes Paul Becker making my dreams come true.
Whoever decided the guys should be dipped at the end was a genius
this one looks like it’ll be really good!  cant wait
Jeremy dancing is the cutest 😭😭😭
I love this show so much and also Julie and luke need to kiss. They have Ozzing lol chemistry in them. How many seasons r there going to be?
amazing the chemistry that Charlie has with EVERYONE
"Thank you for this content, it gives me serotonin"
"Luke reactions, when say “WE GOtTa GO!”"
Jer looks so good in this!
"Wow, this is great. Thank you Paul for braving the dancers to get a closer shot of the boys."
This was so fun to watch and it looks like they had fun filming as well!! Love this so much! Thank you for the endless suport Paul!!!
I love how the girls got Charlie and Jeremy and the boys got Owen 😂🥺
I'm going crazy wanting the second season !!! Me and my daughter... By: Faby and Andy
"4:02 ""don't mess with the hat"" 😃... hahaha ....but let's be honest it was a great move 👏😜 ... hahaha ... obviously you would take his hat off and put it on 😉...Great to see these BTS from HGC rehearsals 👏👏, Thank you Paul ✌"
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED TODAY. THANK YOU PAUL!
This is why we love Jatp 😌🙌🏻

Once Jungkook said: My happiness started when I meet rap monster hyung
"When Jimin called Namjoon "" APPA "" , it really touched me"
Fun fact: RM is the most humble and patient person
_ _*_Namjoon : existed_*_ _   _ _*_vminkook : gives him everything we have_*_ _
The amount of patience Namjoon has to take care of 6 crackheads is amaJin
I wish everyone had a friend like namjoon..

_ _*_Yoongi once said : Namjoon is the happiest when he's with._*_ _   _ _*_“Seokjin”_*_ _ 😭💜
1:07  Jimin: Dad Rm:😶🥺
"Namjoon once said   ""I always stand separately when these people are chaotic so that I can see them and think that choosing them was a right thing to do"""
BTS and ARMY love RM so much. RM is best leader and best hyung 💜💜. He is so kind and humble.💜
When jimin said dad I love you to Namjoon I feel it's confirmed that they know every meme that comes within this fandom cause they know that we always say Namjoon is the father of like six children including fake maknae Jin 😂😂😂
When Jimin said if RM was shorter he would ask her out i was like me too... but then i was like (wait what??) lolll
Jimin:Calling RM Dad! Jiminy real dad: .. Guess my child got adopted 🥲
RM's Future Kids After watching This 👁👄👁
"_ _*_BTS once said :_*_ _  _ _*_""His best is not who could manage our group he is a talented legendary leader in everything""_*_ _"
"Jimin:Dad,I love you  Rm😁🥺"
Namjoon can be a baby and a parent 💜💜
"Dad, I love you!♡"
RM is so cute and then everybody loves rm 😍😍
"As J-Hope said: ""At work, Namjoon is the leader. At home, we are his 6 leaders."" Always remember, Namjoon is a taaaall baby leader! So, darn, cute!!!!"

_ _*_Kim Namjoon is the root and BTS of the whole tree_*_ _   _ _*_I love you BTS & baby Joonie_*_ _
bts is 6 guys who all have a crush on namjoon and don’t try to hide it.
Namjoon is the best leader ever💖🥺
8:32  did anyone notice Jimin tho omg he's zoning out harddddd
"Hoseok's ""He is still a kid"" hit me hard😭❤️"
Not only BTS we all love Namjoon so much 💜
2:00 jin is jealous😂
"2:42 I mean, if I were Taehyung, I'd definitely cling onto him exactly like that too."
No one:     Legit no one:      Not even jk:         Jimin: oh appa
"Everyone loves namjoon, he's the best"
Namjun is the heart of the BTS and the best leader in the world.😊💜
KIM NAMJOON is a good father of BTS..🤴🏻💜
Namjoon treats the members like his own babies. 😘😘😘😊🥰
"2:43 jiminie do be like: get away from my appa, you teal haired ange- I mean tae..."
"""If NaMjOon iSnT yOuR Bias, He is YoUr BiAs BiAs.💗💓💜💜💞"
6:21 ....look whose talking.. Even he is cuter 😂😂
"Joonie is such a leader , Like the way he takes care of them hes just so cute like who wouldn’t love Joonie so much 🥺"
No one:    Literally no one:  Jungkooks: rRraaaaPPpp MonstaAaaaa 😅
"Namjoon, a great leader!"
"I just thought about how much respect the older members have for Namjoon as their leader, see how Hobi reacts at 6:28. Kudos to them for respecting a person younger than them and follow his leadership (though we know that if publicly Namjoon takes care of the members, privately they take care of him☺️) . We stand a family💜"
"Jimin once said: ""Appa saranghaeyo"" Oh no,that's very touching my hearteU😣"
3:23 rm was depicting lord Krishna...omgggg Indian armies where r u all...
2:40. 3:09..im feeling something amazing right now... He loves them so much... 💜💜
Jimin is so Sweet..💜💜💜
Youtube: i'll give you a notification 6 minutes later
My heartue when jimin said apa 🥺🥺
NOT ONLY BTS LUV NUMJOON SOOO MUCH WE ARMYS TOOO LIKE HIM.........
No one : Literally no one: Jungkook : Nam-joon😂
ohhhhhhh it's cuuute    2:42
our great leader kim namjoon I love you Namjoon 💜
RM is such a kind soul on this planet and believe me when i say... without NAMJOON BTS wasn't possible
1:22 Too good😆😆😂🤣 1:45 Tae is always there for entertaining us 🥰🥰
Its Cute How They Call namjoon Dad💜💜
Namjoon is the best leader I have ever seen 💜💜💜
"look just how adorable he is, anyone would love to take care of him."
2:01 AAAAAAA THE KIM LINE SJJDSJKDS
RM is a good leader. Because he care all the members.And he support all the members. All members love him so much ☺️
I love YOU Rm ❤️😊
All I know is that KIM NAMJOON is the best not just as a leader but as a human.
Fun fact: Jungkook auditioned for BTS because he thought RM was cool.     *Honestly I'd do the same*
When our J HOPE'S is born on February 18th .... WAITING😍😍
These dorks are whipped of rm and they don't even try to hide it😂😂 Their ultimate motive: IMPRESS NAMJOON AT ANY COST😂
Jimin callling namjoon Appa... Is really so so so cute😭💜💜💜
Bts react to namjoon giving a hug: aHbahsbmsk NOOOO jungkook: Y.E.S.
Just gonna say that this video is wholesome
"This is what we called ""HYUNG"" connection Taehyung asking Yoongi for hug Yoongi:😒 And we have here Namjoon asking for a hug Yoongi:😚 Taehyung:Huh!Yoongi am i a joke to you???"
6:19  The face of someone who questions is sexuality😂😂
*When RM was warming up his voice- it was literally me in online class in mute while the teacher asks us about homework*
"How can anyone NOT love a man who is so thoughtful, so intelligent, so handsome, and so loving? His lyrics and music have become an integral part of my life. Thank God Namjoon exists."
Will definitely love it because our Leader RM is so cute🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Jimin : yasss best bro 🤪                                      V : yasss best father 😊
i seriously thought tha i was the second view but im late😢
I think they know armys call him daddy seductively but they are making fun of him instead🤣the word daddy in my mother tongue sounds hilarious as well😂😆
"7:32 if kim seokjin says its ""buuuro "" then the word ""bro "" shouldn't exist"
Love u RM 💜
"HE IS THE BEST LEADER, FRIEND AND PARTNER WE ALL DESERVE 💜 HE DESERVES THE WORLD! I'M SUPER PROUD TO SHARE THE SAME BIRTHDAY WITH HIM💜💜💜💜💜💜"
H-how did u got that views in 1 minute your really popular i think you broke the world record  amazing btw i love your videos so much
He is taking care of bts all members as like a big brother.
3:07 lmao yoongi
1:07 i loved jimin 's APPA
"_ _*_Namjoon is the best leader, he is not only the best leader and a good younger brother, but as the elder brother for the makney line he is the root and bts of the whole tree_*_ _   _ "" windshield wipes lovely "" _ 😭💜"
7:28 namjoons birthday being celebrated for about a minute straight 😂
"Jimin calling RM appa    Papa Mochi and his biological father = ""I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me-"""
Namjoon luv u ❤️
the entire maknae line is whipped for namjoon and i honestly can't blame them
These are adorable I love the first one when Namjoon is posing and Junin calls him Lovely.
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 I Love Bts
Hope ur future wife will Take good care of u🙃
All the bts members are still now a playing babies sarangheyo 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
RM is a really good rapper and singer and he is the best in learn👍
"Namjoon is a kind of guy that I really admired,  I want to be a close friend to him...every time I saw him I'm soòoo happy 😊 I want  to meet you someday 🙏"
*IN TAMIL APPA MEANS DAD EVEN IN KOREAN BUT WHEN HE SAID IT MY HEART MELTED*
BTS memes that made Oli leave London
Title idea: BTS Memes that gave Namjoon his handshake
Me: *Chokes on food when I see James Charles near BTS*
James Charles would not pass Tae's vibe check
When you’re watching this in bed in the middle of the night trying so hard not to laugh like a hyena so your mum doesn’t come and take your phone away
The cameraman: *Exists* Jungkook: You wanna see some real speed?
Everyone is ok when jk did his magic trick nd there's yoongi was overacting
“Jimin watching hoseok leave their shared room” I wouldn’t have it in me to leave such a cutie
the one with jin doing the flying kiss and tearing up is what i imagine their last performance will look something like at the end :c
If Jimin looked at me like that someone better be on standby to call an ambulance because I will be swiftly going into *✨c a r d i a c  a r r e s t✨*
excuse me let me gather my UWUs real quick ☝🏻
"1:21 “come to the dark side, we have one chaotic brain cell shared between us”"
"7:33 I literally started sobbing😭😭 He looks at us the same way we look at them, he adores us so much😭😭😭 You can see it in his eyes, ARMYs are his whole universe, he loves us so much😭😭😭😭😭😭"
1:37 jungkook practicing his selca months before
2:16 PLEASE I CANT DO THIS TODAY HE'S A 25 YEAR OLD MAN WHY IS HE SO CUTE
Namjoon in his dreamterview “yoongi as the maknae” and this was the response: 1:27
"The way Jimin stares at armys: me, I probably would have drop dead and be beet red in the face. Who can even make eye contact with this sexy mochi? 😍"
People that need a raise:   JungKooks camera man (because we know that you have to have no legs to chase after Jeon JungKook) R.I.P ✨Legs✨  SUGA’s subtitle person because we know that he doesn’t have fingers in deawitcha after trying to write at the same rate of Suga of rapping and trying to get the timing right R.I.P ✨Fingers✨
8:24 He's called the Golden Maknae for a reason
0:51 jhope was literally trying to poke the zombie😂😂😂😂😂
"2:48 Why would someone create this, why? I'm crying, bye"
0:53 I do the same thing to my mom 💀✋
I also felt bad for James😟Aww he was smiling behind them it was so cute😌 He wanted to meet BTS but he couldn't☹️that's so sad but nevermind better luck next time James😉
Is no one gonna talk about how Yoongi was about to fight Jimin? I  *A S C E N D E D*
Real ARMYs know that behind all those dad jokes and confidence and always breaking the ice to make the members comfortable .... 4:40 is actually the Real Kim SeokJin ... the introvert :)
2:17 I CHOCKED ON AIR..HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE-
2:17 sir- pls calm down- no one likes a murderer- 👁👄👁✋ except maybe me- not the point. kim namjoon calm down thank u
1:31 me telling myself that I learned enough for an exam and still struggling
0:44 poor baby TaeTae~!!🥺
No one: Me: **watches this at 4am in the morning when I’m supposed to be sleeping knowing that I’ll be dying tomorrow but it’s ok because it’s bts**
These memes are iconic 💀
This part made me laugh so hard 8:18 😂😂James Charles
6:03 HE IS SO PRECIOUS😭
5:50 Seokjin holding back his tears so that he could give a flying kiss to Army..😭💜
6:03 omg this made me so soft 😭🥺
"3:05 their fight always starts with "" NO NO NOO NO"" I love them lol"
4:01 omg it is so cute💜
1:20 my lil yoongi is lowkey part of maknae line.
3:12 this made me shed a fuggin tear and im not exaggerating this ✌️😔
Jin giving flying kiss while holding back tears...
4:15 Video : Bangtan playing and trying to keep quiet coz Namgi were sleeping..  Me : Okay.. * trying to control my laughter while watching the clip* Also me : (realises this after the clip ends) *But why was i also laughing silently while watching that clip as if Namgi was sleeping beside me ???*
"James: ""Would you like to be in my video?.""  Taehyung: not- not- NO."
0:24 Jin be like: What have i taught my baby
0:44 AWWWWW he's a baby 😭
2:19 wait which performance is this??
It's a good day to be a seokjinnie bias 🥺🥺🥺
Omg you premiered after my class was over for once 😂
0:21 was the time I chocked with air in my mouth
The secondhand embarrassment when james tried to talk to BTS LMAOOO

"Squad, show some love for this amazing channel💜"
Video: How Jimin looks at army Me: I want that
"4:39 ahhh I remember that.. it still make me go ""awww""🥰😂"
Me trying not to laugh like a hyena watching this  at 4am while my family is sleeping👩‍🦯
the way BTS look at ARMY... no ones ever looked at me like that 🥺 just the pure love in their eyes..
2:26 made me like the video hahaha 😂 sunshinee 💜
Jin did it again. My man doesn't need anything but to exist and his slays like. Who else you know becomes famous jsut cuz they got off a bus?!? Only THEE kim soek jin
Jimin’s a Libra so he knows he’s charm is his eyes
"Bts : breathes  Army : watches,laughs,crys,hugs cat,stare,laugh again for an hour,rewatches,cries,hosts party,dies,plans invitation to funeral"
1:02 Taehyung: I gotta protect mah soulmate ya know... sorry yoongi hyung Jin: lol
Title idea : Bts memes that makes bts to come india 😭💜
"3:24 The way he said ""¡¡AHHH!!"" and army went *""¡¡AHHH!!""* 😭💜"
3:28 Yoongi: what's this sorcery
"I want to say this. Can you download the Mubeat app and get Mubeats to vote BTS? We're losing in almost every category. I already voted a lot already. We need more ARMY to vote, please! (Mochi Chimmy can you please pin this so more people can see it?)"
Other armys when Taehyung calls himself 'tete' - 😍🥺🥰  Filo-armys when Taehyung calls himself 'tete' - 👁️👄👁️
7:30 the seokjin way to get out of things: AAAAHHHH
Sooo you now how yoongi was mad at the balls because they would go in...........RIGHT NOW RIGHT HERE!!!! I BET  HIS GONNA MAKE SONG ON HOW HE HATES THOSE BALLS😎😗      HEY!!! NEW DISSS COMING UP!!!!😎
AM SORRYYY BUT IN 6:03 WHEN TAEHYUNG SAID TETE HIS VOICE WENT HIGH TO 👇LOWWWWWW👇QUICKLY...LIKE DAM BOY  👁👄👁       😭😭😭our little boy is all grown up😭😚💜💜💜
Jimin: ive done kendo for 8 years Also Jimin: *does the bottle trick* 😲😲😲
Jin: I think he saw with eyes in his heart  Me: *faints*
I can imagine that J-hope is really good at giving hugs.
1:54 did he say princess 🤣
1:36. He looks like me trying to send a weird selfie to my friends but keeps doing different poses because I look ugly in all of them
@7:33 made me cry because I know Jimin will never look at me like that :'(
"i always see tweets saying ""the way jimin stares at armys"" thats literally his NORMAL STARE!"
3:10 I really love how Jungkook shares his happiness with his hyungs..😊💜
The way jimin looking at army's m like aaaaahhhhh
Me watching while waiting for Namjoon tweets:      But only ended up seing one 👁👄👁 💧     💧
Title idea: BTS memes that named Jimin find his jams and loose them again
Every time I think of see Jin with blonde hair I just 🥺😭🤧👁👄👁💀
Jimin being the actual flirt is iconic
"JIMIN LAUGHING IN TINY AHAJSJJDJDJF TAE GETTING SQUISHED , THESE CLIPS SENT ME 😩😭"
4:16 me at 3am watching kdramas while preventing my laugh HAHAHAHAHAHA 😂
4:01 Hobi do big dancy and Hobi do little dancy. 🥺💗
“Tete” is what you would call a female that’s older than you and cares for you like a mother if call my aunt Tete haha
"jungkooks ""how you feel"" when he met james charles is soo cute please"
At 2:49 that's me when my parents said stay quiet and they'll bring me chocolates 😭💜
I CANT BREATHEEE WHEN JIMIN SAID “ha” HJAJAHSHS
"i haven't seen Suga's iconic moment with ARMY where she always shouts that she'll sue Min Yoongi because that's why we have that ""sue me"" in Mic Drop. i haven't see anyone upload that in a hot minute. 🙏💜😁"
I ain’t a jimin stan but that little “yaah” almost made me cry
"What was Jimin mouthing in the ""I can't unsee it"" video PLEASE EXPLAIN"
"These boys fill my heart with so much love I can’t hate myself anyone because of them, like I’m so serious they make me so much more happy than when I take my antidepressants"
"Yoongi walking in tiny, so cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 💜💜"
Title: memes that made jimin finally get his jams
1:06 Every introvert can relate to this.
Type in F in the chat to pay respect towards JungKook camera man ✊🤠  He probably got ✨PTSD✨ From that
Ahh I love these boyss 🥺🥺
Jin telling us to scream his name but in a deep voice and his laugh after some army’s did it is the most hilarious thing ever 😅😅😅
"i definitely think the second half of this (from 2:22) is the better half, and if you want to hear the extended part with the humming at the end, it’s at 3:51! let me know what you guys think! <3                       ─── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: .☽ . :☆ﾟ. ─── edit: i uploaded this mashup to soundcloud for those of you who wanted to listen to it there! → link: https://soundcloud.com/planetaerium-youtube/telepathy-say-so"
Ok everything that Seokjinnie touches is gold
this is the mashup we didn’t know we needed until we heard it
"Oh guys, honestly, this mashup was perfect"
also sorry for how ugly the video is. i had to reflect it and add the sparkles and stuff to prevent the say so music video from getting automatically content claimed and subsequently blocked in all countries. blame youtube!
the songs  literally give compliments to each other.
"It literally feels like the SAME song. Seokjinnie, now I'm certain that you work for jinhit entertainment."
I haven’t even finished hearing it and I already love it 😩🤚
"this would go good with IONQIX, the car comercial. or just namjoons part i dunno"
"omgg the other day i was thinking of these two songs and was like ""i wonder if someone has mashed them together yet? that would sound pretty cool"" and here we are lol. its great btw<3"
Anyone else think TXT'S way home and BTS's love maze would go together? Idk
is it weird i had a dream a couple days ago about hearing telepathy on the radio but then say so came on and it somehow got mixed in.........
Imagine going on a road trip with your friends and this song is playing on your car stereo. That'll be lit🔥
i was bobbing my head to this and heard my neck crack..
We need DoJa to react to this... imagine how cute she will react when she sees this... And maybe a future collab
OMGGG THIS US LITERALLY PERFECT the way the humming parts sound so good together.. blown away👏👏👏💕
both of these songs are bops nobody ever thought would ever sound so good together.
I’ve been waiting for more telepathy after that epic dynamite mashup
Nose si entiendes español pero 😭😭😭estuvo hermoso mis artistas favoritos juntos si eso se ase realidad juro que jamás dejaría de oírla 😢
Is my screen broken or this is underrated? 😭 WHAT A MASTERPIECE
3:52 heaven to ears
Definitivamente necesitamos una colaboración  c:
✨ARTEEEE ✨✨💗 ME ENCANTOOOO✨💗
no sabia que necesitaba esta colaboración hasta que la escuche (aquí esta el comentario en español que tanto buscabas 7w7)
AAAAAAA ESTO ES DEMASIADOOOO ARTEEEEEEE
Antes de que haga viral...😎👊🏼
I'm convinced that you can mash up 'Say So' with just about any BTS song and I love it!
"what the hell, this is a masterpiece. ✋😟"
The “say so goes with everything” saga continues and I’m here for it🤩💕💕
the namjoon rap followed by doja’s rap was chef’s kiss oh my god i’m so in love
Okay but why did this slap harder than it was supposed to- this is fire
"Busque este mashup por una semana y ninguna me parecia bonita, me aparecio tu video en recomendados y ahora puedo morir feliz 🤓"
This is so good!! All your mashups are amazing 💕
I saw the notification and I stopped everything to watch this perfection
this is everything that i ever wanted
Both of these songs have that 80’s 70’s vibe and it’s just  𝚌𝚑𝚎𝚏𝚜 𝚔𝚒𝚜𝚜
AGORA VOCÊ TEM UMA FÃ BRASILEIRA🇧🇷🇧🇷 MDS SEUS MASHUPS SÃO PERFEITOS VEYY
Es el mejor mashup que he escuchado en toda mi vida :')
Doja + bts = my life has been complete✨
Who else likes seokjinnies videos before they even start... Also I wish these could be on spotify
When I tell you I was SCREAMING the ENTIRE time.
Ever since I heard telepathy for the first time I thought of a say so mashup
you already had me crying at 0:01
I already know this is gonna be great😌🍵
it sounds so good!! doesn't even feel like a mashup!
Dos joyas juntas es definitivamente ARTE. Necesito colaboración
Please this is actually so amazing. The amount of endorphins and happy chemicals I got from listening to this.  Doja and Bangtan need to collab asap
"Why is this not viral yet? It's incredible, this mashup is a masterpiece, I love it!"
I’ve listened to all of the BTS mashups that are on this channel I literally don’t understand how this works it’s so crazy amazing every mashup blows me away
U r so underrated 😶.  Istg if I was with friends with bts  I would definitely recommend them your channel 💜💜
Seokjin in the thumbnail choked me
No sabía que lo necesitaba hasta que lo escuché 🤧🤝❤️
'Say so' is like a person who will befriend anyone at school...i notice there's a lot of mash up with 'say so'
"when I first heard namjoon's part when the album was released, it really sounded like it's from say so. this is amazing!!"
"I sent it to my mom because she loves both songs. She doesn't stop listening anymore, help me-"
i never realized how good the two songs are together
I always thought these two songs sounded similar in many ways. TY FOR THIS 💜
Not to forget the thumbnail 😭💕 Seokjinnie and Doja
the fact that i can hear telepathy intro and say so intro together at the same time amazes
Omgggg I was hoping you would do something like this cause I also thought that telepathy gave me say so vibes
next thing i knew: i was OBSESSED
Oh my god I literelly was thinking about beats of these songs are so similar when I danced on say so on justdance😂😍😍 love it ..... you have a really good sense of mashing up similar songs💜 I am also very interested in this kind of stuff
yes!! i've been thinking of this mashup for such a long time huhuhu it sounds incredible!!
"i must admit, you never fail to shock me, this is INSANE"
when  seokjinnie makes THE BEST remixes /mashups EVER!!💜
OMG WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
⁝Telepathy⁝ + ⁝Say so⁝ = ARTEEEEE ✨
MEU DEUS QUE PERFEITO
"idek why but now that i hear this, its like say so and telepathy are meant to be, oof how the beat builds up and then drops......... I LOVE THIS SEOKJINNIE"
BrUh I want this on Spotify 😭
rm's and doja cat's rap parts match so well
"I was literally thinking about how good the songs would sound together, I’m so glad someone did a mashup 🥺 you’re  so talented"
Primera debe estar en un museo Ahhh dios es harteee
THE HUMMING AT THE END????!&(@#%^&^$!& LITERALLY HEAVEN PLEASE I-
Pleeeease do SAY SO and IONIQ!!!!  It will be PERFECT 👌🏻
doja vocalizing with jimin and jungkook humming at the end??? actual magic
"""MY HEART BOM BOM"""
This is the best mashup I've ever heard
Exijo colaboración YA Como no los habia escuchado juntos antes Me sorprende que suene tan bien
When i first heard Telepathy it made me think of Say so idk why and then we have this 👁️👄👁️
Can they pls just perform that together already that would be all i need
"Me,casually vibing to this."
Idk why but I feel like fly to my room would also go great in this.
"This is very good, I can probably see this play at a party"
DIOS NECESITO UN COLAB YA YA YA YAAAA YWBFHWBQUXX😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love the way how it blends together so well. This is so good
"многие говорили, что эти песни друг на друга похоже..ну не знаю даже. Но вместе мне эти песни нравятся больше.🙃💜"
"А где это можно скачать)))))) реально офигенное получилось, так и хочется на репите слушать 🌸❤"
"🎵Didn't even notice, there was a great mashup like this!🎵"
I CANT STOP LISTENING TO THIS
Okay but u hve the version with Jimin humming makes it even better
"Can you imagine a collaboration? Uff, the world explodes."
When I first listen to telepathy i always wonder why it gives me say so vibe...
"Aww, their songs are everything 🥰🥰🥰 thank u for one more beautiful addition"
I KNEW SOMONE WOULD DO THIS I TOLD PEOPLE THIS SOUND LIKE THAT SONG LOL
amazing one!! but imagine how cool a mago x say so mashup would be
I don't expected to find that kind of mashup but final result turned into masterpiece  Thanks Seokjinnie for this
"Tbh when I first heard Telepathy, I ended up singing the say so lyrics subconsciously. This mashup was made in heaven"
"Honestly this is the only ""Say So"" mashup on here that makes sense. These two songs fit together so well!"
Girl tell me where you got this much talent It's always amazing

"_""WE NEED JUNG HOSEOK. WE CAN'T MAKE IT WITHOUT JUNG HOSEOK""_  ~ a wise man once said ❤"
Hobi is the most well rounded member of bts. But not everyone’s ready for that convo🧍🏻‍♀️
"This reminds me when : 1. Jk crying so much when hobi decide to leave.  2. They said jk n hobi are the closest of them all (omg i can imagine how hobi take care jk like his own baby brother ) 3. Tae said he has smth which only him he can talk to with.. he ask him first about his condition.. 4. Jimin obviously cant live without him. 😂 5. Jin said if he made mistake, he always look first at hobi to see his reaction  6. RM would be awkward if hobi didn't fill the room with his brightness  7. Suga said he is his charger. And obviously there is no sope without hobi 8. He is the bridge between hyungline n maknae line     Look how good he take care the members and how precious he is.. 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
He is a whole package of everything.💜💜💜
We stan the right man 👑
Jhope be like: Rapping? Yes! Singing? Yes! Dancing? Yes! beatboxing? Yes! Being sunshine? Yes! Being a leader? YES!!!
"This was really beautiful and thanks for this video. I too think he has the leadership qualities next to RM, recently he is trying to answer in English during interviews. People really need to stop sleeping on this guy. His stage presence speaks how good of an entertainer he his. His energy, charisma, listening to others, caring nature all point out towards his leadership qualities. I am proud to be a Hobi stan. Stan Talent, stan Hobi."
"I love all the members. But quote-after-quote, and story-after-story, everyone agrees that Hobi is the only irreplaceable member.  Without him, BTS wouldn't be who they are today."
"What Namjoon said about Hobiii is right...Hobi is like a pillar that hold BTS together..and there where one time Namjoon said if he were to chose one member to be the leader it would be Hobiii..he is such a caring, lovely and kind man..whoever get to married to our beloved sunshine is indeed a very lucky girl"
"Hobi has such a strong work ethic, he takes charge of performances because of how detail-oriented he is. It is really easy to start listening to and take directions from J-Hope. One of the other wonderful things I have noticed about him is that he cares a LOT for the other members. I often find RM feeling awkward when he has to console or comfort the members when they are in pain/upset, Hobi naturally knows what to do or say at those times. His EQ is no joke."
"As a performer and actor myself, I look up to Jhope a lot. He is a real professional at what he does, rapping, singing and of course dancing. Do you ever notice how stable he is in all BTS live performances? He gives us exactly the thing we need sometimes adding some flavors but always so detailed and precise. He has got the ability to change his whole mood performance according to the song they are performing, whether he was singing (Magic shop/ Louder than bombs/) or dancing.   He knows when to kick hard and he knows when to stay quiet and modest (performing wise)  You know that thing he said to JK about knowing your pace? that's exactly how we are taught to behave on stage. This man is outstanding, performing level but most importantly *HUMAN level*  With all my due respect, Jung Hoseok is my idol.  I am also an Aquarius and 26 (Dog Chinese zodiac), I must say it all adds up to him being so close to my heart. Sorry if I was too long, I could talk about him for hours but I will leave it for now.  Love you sunshine Army squad and thanks for your amazing videos Colt Nava."
"hobi's the backbone, the golden hyung. i'm so proud to have him as my bias 🥺🐿"
"Hobi is the second leader, the best dancer and a loving person. BTS and ARMY have felt in love with Hobi over and over again 💜💜💜"
"Namjoon himself said he would choose hobi for the leader position , that itself says everything. Thank you so much for this video💜"
His laughter is infectious... His smile is very beautiful
J-HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPE
"There was a mother army with a son who had an illness that caused fits and crying and screaming, a lot of emotional distress for the little boy. I don't remember the exact condition. But the mom posted online that she plays Hobi's Hope World mixtape and she said her son stops and listens to his voice. Hobi helps the boy like no one else can. I 'm wondering if the kid is doing better. Does anyone know?"
His smile make me refreshed in my hard times i think he deserve this world. 🤩❤️💜🤩😘😘😘😘
My hope  My king My dream  My sunshine My bias  For ever Young💜
"Awww, this made me emotional. Hobi does not really reveal what he does for BTS, he never gives himself too much credit. Unless the members hype it themselves, we wont really know. Thank you for this vid!!!"
Jhope is the ultimate mood maker of the group. His positive and joyful nature uplifts & motivates everyone around him 🌞🌝
"I am glad all the members respect him to that level of calling him their second leader.  I know Namjoon is grateful for all the help that he provides.  Jhope, I must say, is one hell of a guy.  I love the video."
You forget nickname golden hyung
I cried.. I'm just happy to see him get the right appreciation. Love you to the eternity. This is soo heart warming.. 💜 Sunshine squad keep supporting our hope..
#army loves hobi and bts
"Aries, Leo, Capricorn are born leaders but out of them, Aquarius peeps are usually the most balanced leaders because they treat everyone equally and are very just which is why all the BTS members are fans of Hobi because he treats all of them equally and is equally attentive to all of their well-beings. I've seen so many analysis videos of BTS where one member is closer to another compared to the rest( e.g. JK with Jimin or Jimin with V or Namjoon with Jin) but Hobi is probably the only member who has the most number of videos being close to all the BTS members whether it's RM or Jin or JK or V or JM or Suga. You can ship Hobi with anybody because he's equally caring and loving towards everyone.  P.S: All signs are great. Don't be disheartened if you're not any of these four signs and especially if you're not an Aquarius ;) :P You still have the potential to be a great leader just like our Hobi dearest ^__^"
"Whoa....I'm early This video was so emotional, ahh thank you so muchhhhhhhhh💜💜💜 I appreciate that you bring out true facts😊💜"
"Really great video.. That talks about our sunshine,our hope, our hobi.... Really I admire him as a dancer, rapper, singer, leader as mentioned in the video, his character...list goes on..... I want a person like him in my life because I'm a silent person....he is very bubbly, responsible, funny, caring and most important making others smile in their hardships....his smile makes my day .. .My dream is to meet him and ofcourse BTS too...i hope it happens one day😄💜so thank you so much for the video 💜😄"
So emotional 🥺 His personality gives so much hope to do our best💜
In today world....... beautiful or handsomeness is more important than talent..........that's why people go after prettiness instead of talent.........he is so talented but people think he's least handsome in BTS..........BUT for me HOBI is most talented and handsomest ............I am OT7 but still HOBI is my favorite........REAL ARMY always love you HOBI............LOVE YOU HOBI &LOVE YOU BTS FOREVER..............💜❤💜
"Siiiii el es el segundo lider y se gano muy bien esa posición por ser tan carismático, trabajador, responsable,  cuidadoso de sus compañeros, pero sobre todo por ser observador y conocer las necesidades del grupo además de ser la energia que todos necesitan. Por eso lo amo y lo respeto es un amor de persona y un pilar importante dentro de BTS como cualquiera de sus compañeros pero el simplemente brilla. ❤💞"
He is a natural and born leader. I always admire his leadership. And I think he IS as what members said the one who kept the team going and stable. Everyone have their own struggle in BTS but he helps and leads them toward the better. I'm very glad BTS have Jhope as a dance leader and a team member. Even RM admitted Jhope mostly complete the roles of a leader better because he actually leads them in term of performance and mental stability as overall offcam. I also sometimes noticed very small things he did for the members silently and this video is the proof that he deserve more appreciation for it. I dont care about others but I am gonna start calling hobi as the second leader of bts from now on 💜💛
"This is by-far one of my favorite fan made videos about j-hope. You really encapsulated his value to the group very well. J-hope really caught my attention because of all of the qualities you mentioned, not to mention, the sheer respect , adoration, and love the other members of BTS have for him. Not minimizing the other’s relationships (they all love one another very much), but when you pay attention to their interactions, there is always something special with how the others interact with him, than how they interact with the others. There is a slightly different energy. J-hope really is a special bright “hope” in this world. Anyways, keep it up. I always enjoy your videos."
"I love everything about this man.Always there to be the stress reliever,the pain killer.Seeing his smile actually brightens my day. He is not popular like the other members(According to my evaluation after watching BTS videos)but he is the glue who kept BTS together.The members said it different times. He is my everything.😘😘😘 My sunshine valentine😘😘😘 My hope,my heart,my life💜💜 💜💜💜Borahae Hobi-ah💜💜💜💜"
I love this video. This needs to show to people who don’t appreciate hoseok. They thought he’s only doing the funny side BUT they don’t know off cam/back stage his the most hard working and trying his hard to make everything to help other members in everything weather during after performances. He’s always making sure the all members is safe physically mentally. I always though he got a mother instinct too. He’s so pure. A blessings to everyone who’s around him. I love you hobi.
"I've been an army for 3 months and the first month getting to know them was mostly by watching compilation vids and as usual, they only show the side of hobi being a total sunshine but as i watch bts in the soop, there was that side of hobi that i really didn't expect. He was so caring and always there to help others (especially when it is time to cook). His personality was just so likeable that i kept on focusing on him for the rest of the show."
"Hoseok seems the hardest to read out of the seven, imo. But by watching this video, it is clear that if he would have been proficient in English, like Namjoon, he would have had a more prominent role in front of the camera. His dancing skills are not even up for a debate"
Because he is literally the meaning of perfection. 💜 That's why I proud to stan him.. No matter what.. When you J hope in you will never J hope out..
I really love this video  Hope every army can appreciate him as bts and and all ot7 armies and you do  He is really my role model and I love him so much  An true inspiration  Thank you once again
We all love you j hope you are actually a pillar of bts because you always support others ♥️♥️♥️
Hobiii my loveee💜💜
Thank you so much for this.. ily ❤️🥺 Our sunshine is perfect.. he deserves more..
Ohh man why i'm crying🥺🥺🥺 jhope💜
I'm in love with this series. Finally 💜💜 upload more of these Colt. you're always the best in showing the unknown sides of him to ARMY.
He leads and teaches the Choreography since he has dance in hiphop the longest☀️
"He is the perfectionist..wth lovely voice,best dance,n beautiful heart...a big support of leader Namjoon💜ever smiling face..he alwz monitor thr choreography...a responsible person."
I really really love this man always have a positive vibes. The  sunshine hopeworld second leader 🥰🤴 my ego
He is the person you hug after you stop being depressed to make you smile even harder because you wouldnt ever see that beautiful  face frown
What can j-hope not do is the question.
Really?? I'm just knowing this but from the very start Jhope Jhope hyung has always been my BIAS and now I'm learning this about him.....
"Even the members themselves said that if RM wasn't the leader, it could've been Hobi. But BigHit had plans and made a total of 3 leaders. Leader for performances is Hobi, leader for the whole team is RM and the leader when off stage is Jin."
Namjoon is the brain Seokjin is the comfort  Yoongi is the vision Hoseok is the order Jimin is the passion Taehyung is the soul Jungkook is the pride of his six hyungs.     That what makes BTS goes well with each other.  Everyone has an irreplaceable role in the group that cannot be duplicated.
"He always cares for them and love them so much💜He always cheers up the members when they are down💜He always comforts the members when they are sad💜He always cheers up the members when they are down💜He is the Sunshine of BTS..🧡💛 Jhope, at a point of time when you are sad just remember that the members and Army are always there for you💜💜..We are there for you not only in your happiness but also when you are feeling down and will comfort you..💕💕"
Advanced happy birthday hobie 💜
"I read BTS staff wrote about how BTS members actually are behind the camera. It says that “Hobi is a  kind of person who just sits there quietly and still always members come around him. He responses everything anyone says to him even when he’s doing something with his cellphone, and still his responses are sincere, that’s why everyone come around him and talk to him without a break all the time.”  Hobi is truly kind and caring person, and he doesn’t even care if that’s something people compliment him about, this is just the way he is. Such a pure beautiful soul he has."
"Srsly ppl need to stop sleeping on our sunshine dancing,vocals and leadership abilities😑😑and did I mention his visuals are like that of an angel😍😍"
"I can't even put into words how much I love this man. He smiles, I smile. He cries, I cry. Let's protect our sunshine and make him feel loved always. 💛💜"
I can't believe humans like jhope actually exist💞
That is so beautiful.💜💜 And that was great. Comments : 1 but when i refresh it's more but the number is still one  YouTube is getting drunk again.😂😂
do any of you have a friend similar to Hobi? I cannot imagine meeting such a good person in my life and I'm wondering if anyone else has someone who reminds them of Hobi
"In 7:07, the member is supposed to say something about the person to the right. Jimin being the last, he had to say something about jhope. Namjoon here just cannot help but express facts!"
5:42 This hopekook moment really made me tear up just look at kookie how he's attentively listening to his hyung😭😭😭
"And some people are still questioning why I'm dead set in love with this guy right from the start.  I often feel so pissed of some immature fans who just tend to see how he act outside, calling him loud and obnoxious without even trying to learn more about how awesome of a personality he is on the inside. How soft and gentle he is to his team member, how unselfish he is, how fast he is to lend his hand or ear each time the member face some difficulties.  The more I learn about Hobi, the more I fall in love with him.. I really hope Armys can see more about his good traits and not speak negatively about him.. we don't even know them personally smh.. so stop being judgemental.."
Slowly I begin to understand why RM told JH that they wont make it without him..... (when he was thinking of leaving)
"I remember a moment, when RM couldn't speak English anymore (something that sometimes happens to non-native speakers, like ""sorry, I can't anymore... my head just won't form proper sentences"") - plus, in his defence, the translator stepped in a little late - and J-Hope just took the mic from him and somehow managed to continue."
"I remember a youtuber pointed on his laugh and said ""he's still looking fine while laughing"". Me: YouGotThePointMan!"
"RM is a true leader.  But hobi is our second leader. If RM wasn't there,there would be no BTS. If hope wasn't there, there would be no hope in our life"
I have no words to express the respect i have for him
I remember years ago Namjoon saying that if he couldn't be leader then Hobi should be the leader.
"I became a Jhope biased from his laughter at 3:30... Literally when I started finding BTS 6 months ago, I saw lot of their interviews, there I saw one person who started to dance in the middle of the interviews.. I found it funny. And when I saw this particular clip of him and Jimin, that sound of his laughter just soothed me... 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
The reasons we call him Golden hyung
"I fully agree that Hobi is the second leader of the group.  Largely thanks to him, the group's choreography looks so powerful and synchronous.  He is a real professional and a very sunny person.  The soul of the group ... I really like him both as an artist and as a person.  Love him"
He is the sunshine that makes BTS more brighter.💜😇😇
He is literally perfect  ❤❤❤❤❤❤ 1. Looks ✔ 2. Cute ✔ 3. Supportive ✔ 4. Caring ✔ 5. Golden hyung ✔ 6. Effortless dancer✔ 7. Rapper ✔ 8. Song writer ✔ 9. Great leader✔ 10. Sunshine ✔ ❤❤❤❤❤❤ Then why the most unpopular member 🥺🥺💜💜
Because he is the main key of BTS that keep BTS always together 😊😊
2:28 When Jin call his name he is really surprise and that shows how modest he is 😢💜
The sweetest and the most down to earth person i know🥰he always put others first before him.he is so lovable and easy to get along with.he always smile even in pain.he cares for everybody and so talented.that why so many people  loved him.❤he put all the love everything he does💖im not army but im a fan 🥰
"Damn this video made me so emotional I cried. Hobi and I have a lot in common and that's why I can relate to almost everything he says and does, and what people tell about him. He really is the best second leader of BTS, he's a great support to the others and to Namjoon in particular, because he knows how hard it is to be the leader of the biggest group in the world. I remember him saying that he wanted to improve his English to help Namjoon translating when they are in other countries, because Namjoon already carries a lot of responsibilities and he succeeded, his English got so much better in a short period of time and he started to speak a lot more, letting Namjoon rest. He's someone we should all look up to, because he's a great role model (not the others aren't, but we're talking about him now)."
The 1st time I saw BTS Jhope locked my eyes with his smile (his smile is heart shaped) that smile makes me stay hobi biased  Now I m OT7 but hobi is my ultimate love  💜💜💜💜
Everyone : Saying best things about hobi....  Me : HOBI.....MARRYY MEEEEEEEEE......PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!
"For anyone wondering what happened at 4:43, There is a hole in the floor that Hoseok saw and no one else seemed to notice. Considering Namjoon was standing directly in front of it, Hobi gave him a tap on his leg to warn him. Namjoon didn't get the hint so Hobi pushed his out of the way so he didn't get hurt."
"*_As soon as I started watching this,I knew this was going to be amazing._*"
JHope never has to say a word for us to know how awesome he is. It use to kill me when he said he didn’t get any fan comments like some of the other guys. When you see pictures of Jhope you see how beautiful of a man he is. He’s respected the most from the boys and ARMY. He deserves so much more than we give him. I’m OT7 but if I did have a bias it would be Hobi. Sometimes I think we don’t deserve such a wonderful person.
Hobi: *laughs* Me: *doesn't know why he is laughing* Also me: *laughs too*
"If he had left the group, the current BTS would not have existed. Nice personality, high professionalism, attractive face, and wonderful ability.He has all of these.It is understandable that the members love him and respect him very much."
*if Jhope was the leader anyone wouldn't dare to allow even sneeze cause he is so strict with his Hawk eyes*                        *Taehyung : 🤧* *Jhope : 😤*
People should really stop sleeping on our hobi   Ps. I really love your vids  You nice keep going💜💜💜
That's why we call him sunshine 🔆💜🌎he is our golden champ💜💫we love you hopeeeeeeeeeee👑👦
"If it wasn't for this sunshine, my six other bros will not be one of kings of amazing performances. It was because of this shining angel, that they are glued together to the end! It's because of his beautiful heart smile, there's a reason to smile! If it wasn't for his contagious laugh, his brothers and ARMY'S will have nothing to brighten our days! THIS SUNSHINE IS THE WORLD'S TRUE RAY OF SUNSHINE AND DESERVES ALL THE LOVE! 💕💕💕"
"He is a good leader of BTS ... He is a caring person to everyone , also taught them how to dance, singing and praise them..."
He is literally perfect more than anything I can't describe how much I love him 🥺💜💜💜
"I believe RM is right JHope would be a good leader. They respect him also  J-Hope you have my vote in that , 💜💜"
At the end of video I ended up tearing my eyes without realizing but it's happy tears😊😊😘💜💜💜💜💜
J-HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPE
Our Hobi is afterall the golden hyung He always radiates positive vibe and a very valuable member in BTS Hoseok is a diamond in the rough I am really proud of him 💜
That's why jhope is GOLDEN HYUNG
Amo la existencia de jhope. Jhope es puro amor.  Igual que todo BANGTAN.
Hobi is our sunshine without sun there is no morning

It's fun unless it's funny. Jungkook just having his normal time I have noticed he doesn't get along with people at first meeting. Shipping is good unless it's cute I don't know why they drag ships and make everything cheesy?
Lindo encontro . AMEI.   Como é entre os artistas ter respeito pelo trabalho de todos  colegas desta área  artística.  💋 💋 💋 💋 💋 💋 💋 💋 💋

9:26 Sweet Night e Dynamite 7v7
"Если он заценит Tony montana, я сойду с ума"
"У бтс (у репперов бтс) такие песни много. Посмотрите разные,  мне особенно нравится Cypher 4 и Ddaeng. Рекомендую вам"
"BTS - comeback home, это то, чего ты от них не будешь ожидать"
"Давай теперь не клипы, а их живые выступления Зацени BTS-Tear live"
"Есть трек на это выступление, есть ещё песни рэп-лайна)) например BTS - UGH"
"BTS- Tear (live), Cypher medley ЭТО САМОЕ КРУТОЕ ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО ПОСМОТРИ"
можно реакцию на Tony Montana Agust D (feat Jimin) одна из самых лучших работ Agust D
Cypher Pt.2 bts просто у Шуги там под конец настолько быстрый и чёткий  рэп что просто💥
2 реакция на БТС за неделю? Это что то новое 🤯😍
"Ахринеееть, кто предложил вам это, я кланяюсь этому герою. Из-за инэта уведомление пришло не сразу, аоаоаоао"
Agust D - Tony Montana и BTS - Cypher PT.2
"Кстати к реп-лайну относятся : Ким Намджун(RM) Мин Юнги (Suga ; Agust D) Чон Хосок(J-hopе)  Аминааааа, благодарю тебя 💜 💜 💜 💜 💜"
"Это рэперы bts, Лидер группы Намджун, он же Рэп Монстр, Шуга и Джей Хоуп. И это нарезка из нескольких выступлений. И первым читает Рэп Монстр. И по моему там  RM даже на английском читал, если я не ошибаюсь. Ты знаешь только Шугу ? обрати внимание и на других рэперов. Всегда восхищаюсь лидером группы который в совершенстве владеет английским и держит команду на вершине. А вообще у них много лайфов. Если интересуешься рэпом , то не лишнем будет по больше посмотреть . Равнодушным не останешься . Они взрывают зал  смотреть и смотреть их концерты одно удовольствие . И читают все трое. Фишечки от Джей Хоупа это нечто. А Намджун чуть голос новерное не сорвал. Ведь читают в живую"
Каждый раз при просмотре их выступлений в живую(особенно  этого) у меня идут мурашки 😱
"Можно реакцию на BTS- Tear(тоже песня рэп лайна), вот это тоже сносит мне башню ахахах еще UGH, Ddang"
"Можно реакцию на BTS - Fire, BTS - Dope🔥"
"У бантан всегда шикарные выступления. Выступления рэперов сносят голову, а выступления вокалистов разрывают душу."
"А Шуга ведь говорил своим хейтерам, что-то типа ""скажите спасибо, что я в к-попе"" 😎"
ОБОЖАЮ твои реакции забей ты на тех кто говорит о твоём английском ты лучший!Посмотри выступления Black pink  pretty savage ♡сразу на первом ряду буду ждать🥺💕
"Не знаю какая будет у тебя реакция на другие живые выступления , если на это у тебя офигенная реакция😂❤️"
"Честно не ожидала увидеть реакцию на сайфер, удивили"
"Если вы перешли к лайвам, то может, вы зацените и живое выступление BTS на MMA 2019? Эх, вот бы кто-нибудь предложил это... **вздох**"
"как раз искала какое-нибудь видео, под которое можно покушать. во время ролик вышел 😸"
Да вы просто обязаны посмотреть Outro: Tear! И Cypher 4!!! 😍👏✊😎 И Tony Montana!!!!!! 🙏🙏🙏
Можно реакцию на BTS-Jump
"Мне кажется стоит побольше именно выступлений BTS  посмотреть что то типа We are bulletproof, Dionysus  и тд) должно понравится, у них много выступлений нереально взрывных. Тони Монтано тоже кстати вероятно тебе зайдёт от Шуги и Чимина. А вообще мне кажется если посмотришь хотяб одно полное выступление ребят на шоу ММА 19 https://youtu.be/b9cG4DzpL_c то как они отдаются на сцене, как меняют стили, как в принципе они подготавливают свои выступления вплоть до мельчайших деталей. Ну и сразу несколько песен посмотреть и послушать в одном выступление)  Мне кажется это то что стоит посмотреть)"
разумеется они запыхаются ведь до этого они часами и пели и одновременно танцевали показывали настоящий шоу.что аж по лицу пот видно и волосы мокрые)
RM ft Suga J-hope - outro tear посмотри пж
Реакция - огонь 🔥 ждём пытливо реакцию на BTS(Suga) - Shadow 💯

Спасиьо огромное за реакцию😌🙏! Я очень вам благодарна🥺
Можно пожалуйста реакцию на BTS - UGH
"Вы просто обязаны посмотреть BTS - Outro Tear  🙏🏼  там такая энергетика ,такой реп 🔥"
"Всмысле: ""если бы это было треком?"" это их трек Линия Cypher имеет 4 песни Ты послушал третью Просто это видео склеено из отрывков с этой песней из нескольких выступлений живых Но честно Cypher pt 4 мне больше нравится"
никогда ещё так быстро не кликала на видео
"Надеюсь, ты посмотришь когда-нибудь BTS - tear (Wembley) live https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0n0nQph3bM"

"СПА СИ БО за ваши видео! Есть концерт Wings там сразу 4 сайфера за одно выступление, но видео идёт 9 минут. Часто пересматриваю!"
"Cypher от реперов BTS шикарны на живых выступлениях, обожаю ещё их трек Tear, когда все думали, что песня о их личных переживаниях в расставании с девушкой, а оказалось Шуга писал думая о распаде группы, трек пропитан печалью и крутой мелодией."
"О боже, как внезапно"
"Сделайте, пожалуйста, реакцию на клип Rap Monstra - Joke🙏🙏🙏"

"На этом видео нарезка из разных выступлений, поэтому участники в разных аутфитах под один трек непрерывный.  Ребят было всего 3е: RM, J-Hope и SUGA. Думаю визуально это немного вас запутало, хотя я могу ошибаться. Спасибо чудесному герою с booste, и не надеялась что так скоро мы сможем увидеть реакцию на сайфер💜"
Мой шок в шоке! Это что снова БТС? Моя любимая песня💜
"Песня реально крутая, тут выступали только реперы, первый куплет читал RM, затем был J-Hope, потом Suga, они круто выступили не смотря на то, что за несколько минут до этого у них были другие выступления с танцами, всегда поражалась, как у них всех хватает дыхалки на такие масштабные выступления, просто молодцы 💜💜💜 Жутко хочу побывать на их концерте и прочувствовать всю эту энергию, что исходит от них"
Ой как рада спасибо за реакцию . АМИНКА  и тебе спасибо 😍  У бтс  для меня самые лучшие  реперы.😍 Твой английский просто классный не обращай внимание что говорят 👍

Да и к тому же, человека знающего, всегда приятно слушать) PS Удачи вашему каналу💛"
"Кстати да, песни реп-лайна всегда сносят крышу Если тебе понравилось это выступление, значит и понравится живые выступления с песнями ""Tear"" ;""Ugh"" и ""Ddang"" Кайфую с твоих реакций Посмотри пожалуйста)"
у бтс один из сильнейших рэп лайнов  треки конечно огонь но полностью они раскрываются для меня особенно на живых выступлениях  невероятная энергетика и харизма
"Пожалуйста, пожалуйста, пожалуйста, молюсь 🙏BEWHY-GOTTASADAE🙏🥺🙏"
"Приятно, что ты ребят на беках отметил, тоже тащусь как они друг друга поддерживает, согласитесь это создаёт атмосферу)"

"""Ты не ломаешь вещи, а моё сердце."" Классная новая цитата."
Как же я люблю это лицо Юнги когда он имитирует удивлённост
Вторая часть уже завтра :)
Ведущий: Чонгук самый сексуальный мужчина в мире. Я: а че вы совменелялись в этом?😑
Чимин: Нижний белье. Я: 😂😂😂
Чимин между Джином и Тэхеном как маленькая уточка сидит😻
"Тэхён такой красивенький,такой милаш, так рада что Юнги с ребятами💜"
Наконец в полном составе ☺️🔥
"Раньше Тэ всегда трогал Чонгука, а теперь Чонгук все время трогает Тэ 😂"
3:12 Хосок: развел руками Мозг Чонгука: повтори Гук: зачем? Мозг: НАДО!
"У BTS на каждом интервью харизма бьёт ключом. Особенно нравится, когда они начинают угадывать что-то о друг друге. И эти разочарованные лица, когда они не угадывают ☹️😄 Спасибо за озвучку Кайл 💓"
"Джин😂😂 с широкими плечами надо родиться, верно ведь говорит 😂😂"
"Я ждала, очень ждала👀 7 бантан, 7 чудес света, здесь какие-то связи 🤔 И да, я должна была это  сказать ЮНГИИИИИИИИИИ"
*Семеро любимых во всём мире парней* 🥺💜
"Ну почему я всегда ржу, когда Чонгуа называют самым сексуальным МУЖЧИНОЙ мира😁😁😁 может потому что для меня он такой ребеночек))) и даже на сцене, когда пытается ""выделываться"", я вижу в нем мальчугана😆"
"Как же мило 🗿💕  Джей-Хоуп: Это твой секрет такой ширины плеч?  Джин : Ну нет , я таким родился ..🗿  И ещё ...ЮНГИ ВЕРНУЛСЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯ,ААААА💕💕💕 Спасибо за озвучку 💕💕"
Почему Тэхену так идет такой стиль🤭🔥
"- Ты это я. - Я это ты. Они до сих пор помнят это 🥰☺😊 милооо) Мне кажется, Чимушку слишком загримировали...сразу взгляд упал на глаза. А он ведь итак красивый, его можно даже и не красить вовсе, всё равно глаз не оторвать😊 Юнгииии...вот, кто отжигал😆 просто наблюдайте за его лицом)) милаш😃"
"А вы заценили эти рубашки у Намджуна, Тэхёна и Чонгука? Они такие классные)) 😍"
Тэхёнчик просто нереальный🖤 И Шуга наконец-то вместе с со всеми🥺 P.S. Спасибо за озвучку
Образ Чон Гука и Чимина очень красивый. Прям залипает. Но они все классные.
"-Так вот почему у тебя такие широкие плечи -Нет, я таким родился 😅"
"Джин, видать, решил догнать по мускулам Чонгука и Намджуна (а то все плечи, да плечи 🙂) и купил турник💪. Надеюсь, он не как Шуга подтягивается 😂😂😂"
*Хосок на протяжении всего интервью* ⬆️↗️➡️↘️⬇️↙️⬅️↖️↕️↔️↪️↩️⤴️🔝🔃🔙🔛🔚
"Я очень рада, что Юнги вернулся❤️"
"Я прямо как Джин,только я делаю не десять подтягиваний в день, а в год 😅😂6:58"
Ох уж эти удивлённые лица бтс 😍🤤 особенно Юнги💜💜💜💜
Как смеётся Хоуп😂😂это отдельное искусство
В этом выпуске не могу оторвать взгляд от Чонгука
"Аж не верится😍что все это озвучивает один человек. У всех разные голоса, уже в голове их всех слышу (представляю) с твоим голосом и могу не смотреть на экран и угадать, кто сейчас говорит. Кайл, респект тебе!🤍"
"Кстати 01:25 맛집 Изначально означает ресторан, известный своей вкусной едой, но также используется для обозначения чего-то/кого-то, кто хорош тем, что он предлагает. Вот почему Чимин делает жест ""Заходите"" :)"
"Кайл большое тебе спасибо за то, что мы можем посмотреть и послушать наших любимых мальчиков!"
"Мне кажется, или Юнги похудел 😕"
"*Какие они красивые, особенно Чонгук и Ви😍🔥*"

"Спасибо за озвучку! Намджун.боже,такой роскошный!Каким шикарным мужчиной  вырос! Когда считали слоги в начале,у Тэхёна был такой вид:Бля,вы что серьёзно?Боже, куда я попал! Куча взрослых мужиков изображает бурную заинтересованность. Даже стыдно,на какой возраст это рассчитано??? Одна радость,посмотреть на наших мальчиков. Как хорошо что Юнги опять в строю! Всё таки  реально его не хватало.Семь есть семь! 7-1 =0"

Stan James Corden 😌🤚
James Corden is a wonderful host to our Bantang boys. Thank you sir!👍👍👍💕😊
We Stan and love a supportive father 💜😭
So cute friendship among them 😍😍😘🥰🥰 Baby Mochi + Papa Mochi 😍
"the question now is... ""Who is Mama Mochi?"" 😂😂😂"
So sweet of Gordon!!!
Papa Mochi and Baby Mochi💜🥰
My reason for learning who BTS are... Carpool Karaoke! And all just because I wanted to learn J-Hope's name. Next thing I know... I am learning of their backgrounds and then listening to their songs 🥰😍😃
That's our jimin 💜
jimin😍😘💖
We stan papa mochi..💜💜
Wow heart touching 🥰😀💜
Part of Family
"When BTS went back after the Grammys, while they were in the green room at the start, JM called J Corden 'Papa Mochi' again but Corden didn't answer him. Hm.. I think he had forgotten about it all. & then when it trended worldwide JC obv was thrilled - & started talking abt it..He didn't give JM a chance to spk on the after Grammy show! - poor JM, he looked at the camera, opened his mouth to spk but didn't do it fast enough for JC - & he wrapped it up & so JM didn't get to spk. Evbody likes the attention they get when they are linked to BTS I think. Clout-seekers! But JM hasn't forgotten - he wasn't impressed & now he just plays along. Am not sure either JM or TH are impressed with all the fake love (a-ha! see wht happened there🤣) they get from some US celebs(Corden is techn Eng but he went very L.A a while back)💜"

"Even though this is all fictions, so many analysis can be made.   the members of BTS and BigHit Entertainment are telling the world that men can have friendship bonds that are emotional and sometimes more than their female counterparts. It’s okay to express your love for your friends whether you’re a male or female.   The second takeaway is mental health. Everyone in the BU has some sort of mental issue and having that person who can share and relate your mental issues helps a lot. Hoseok and Jimin are caused by the past. Namjoon and Taehyung are caused by poverty. Yoongi and Jungkook are caused by a self-identity crisis. Even Seokjin has this mindset where he believes he must be there all the time to save the boys from their tragedies. As the story progresses, we see That Seokjin becomes more paranoid and bottling up traumatic memories from his friends. Unfortunately this excessive stress causes him to lash out on his friends.   The third takeaway is more of a philosophical point. Some of the characters commit suicide because they either believe their existence will cause sadness on others or they don’t see the reason to live.  In reality, everyone person matters in this world. Some people may not like you simply by your presence but there is someone grieving if you take your own life.  The second answer is more controversial but please give it a thought. Some people think that we don’t have a purpose for being born. If you believe you are a coincidental being then why are there moralities? Who instilled the sense of importance in us? Who instilled the sense of respect for oneself and others? I personally believe it was God since we were made in His Image. Being made in His Image means we love, have passion, and act like God but through the Fall, we can’t achieve that perfectly.   Sorry for the long deep comment but I felt like someone needed to read this. Thank you and have a great life."
'Hoseok still talks with Yoongi'  *plays otsukare in background*
"I just solved all of Jins problems: If he just send all 6 boys to a therapist...  But seriously real life is so much more boring, just go to a therapist.😄"
*wow just wow am so  honored to have someone like you in the fandom I can't imagine the fandom army without you you have helped many people to understand bts's  message i! Love you so  much* 💜😭🍭
I hope that drama Youth will come out soon so that we can die peacefully after understanding this freaking storyline
It´s just a fictional story but my heart hurts to see Jin in this situations.... And thank you for your hard work! I don´t know what I would do without your brain.
I want you to meet BTS like GIRL U DESERVE IT.
I think Hoseok has the placebo effect I think he thinks he has that thing that makes him fall and he’s living the red pill and blue pill life (WINGS and I NEED U) he’s a mix of joy and evil (Boy meets evil) in the WINGS tour Hobi was about to perform MAMA but it showed him behind a wall with colors (Blue and Red) and it said PLACEBO all in red and the wall was blue...He was a joyful kid while growing up but the day when his mom left him it was the day he lost his innocence he realized that not everything is joyful and that’s when he met evil (Boy Meets Evil) He actually says “Placebo” in MAMA too
"the whole btsu timeline can just be summed up as ""i'll guess I'll die"" meme"
We should probably put a trigger warning for suicide no..?
"Me: damn, stop analyzing their story, it's been years but you know nothing.  also me: I see, I see, Seokjin should do that, yeah."
the last time i was this early jimin still had his jams
"I'll be honest, I just enjoy their music, interviews and vacation vlogs. The rest is more than I can keep up with XD"
In short the BTS universe is different reality’s for Jin when he does something everything changes like a butterfly effect but the reality is that no matter how many times Jin tries to save them something bad always happens for example Yoongis room changes When Jin tries to find Namjoon he instead finds Jk on his car roof while driving (Webtoon) Jimin and Hobi are still in hospital and Jimin wasn’t convinced to leave everything still changes no matter what
omg thank you so much for this!! u have helped me a lottttt with understanding the storyline and making my own theories and also letting me see and have knowledge about things that i don’t have access to...thank you a lotttt <3
I just feel baad for Jin because no one could see how much Jin is suffering from saving all his members
Because i haven’t play the game in a long time all i know is that it’s connected to TxT because of the cat so yeah-  *also notice how the Hyungs are switched Yeonjun needs help and Jin is trying to save the members but in Yeonjuns case he needs help*
"At this point, this fictional stories shouldn’t hurt me so much... But damn they are so tragic... CANT THEY JUST BE HAPPY BIGHIT?"
"THANK YOU FOR THIS, IT SAVES SO MUCH MORE TIME !"
I m starting to think that i am getting classes for a course called bts universe 🙈....and this is hard to understand.... And that i would also have a test later ... But i like this subject so much like i used to like english subject in school😂🙈💜
It hurts how much Jin suffers trying to save the 6 boys.
Do you think if Soekjin did admit it at least to Taehyung the scene would of be  of them talking things out
Amazing summary can't wait for the update on the storyline....I really wanna know what the hell happened after the highlight reels thou🤔😭😭
"I was like ""yayy finally he saved everyone!!"" Nd than V n jin had a fight. This story will never end literally. But i want more mvs related to BU like I need u..they haven't released one for so long."
"I love the way how bighit planned how to continue the story in different ways. Starting in the MV's, Notes Book, Save Me Webtoon and now the BTS Universe."
Can’t wait for the updated BU storyline !!! Hopefully it’s soon if you’re able 💜
Thank you for doing this. My brain never been able to keep up without external help 😭😭😭💜💜💜💜💜
"I feel so bad for Jin! No matter how hard he tried , reality is still reality , fate is still fate , he still can’t save them"
I couldnt install this because my phone couldnt handle it but seeing the events-
"I can't help but shed tears about these theories, I know these storylines aren't real but man they do be hitting."
"What if this whole journey was only part 1 of the whole bts universe😭😭 Btw, thank you so much for all the effort to explain it to us!! God bless you💜"
"Thank you queen,, 💜 As for Seokjin yeah I will get really mad about Taehyung, feels like all the effort that he put in to made all of them alive is worthless, they didn't know everything though, One things is for sure that If Seokjin finally admit all of this and they will figure out to help each other and also themselves too... But their situations are really frustrating cause they have a battle within themselves, I'm so excited for your updated summary, stay safe and love lots 💜💜"
"Watching your videos helps me a lot, especially the storyline explanations. I'm sure it takes a lot of time and energy to do all the things that you do. Thank you so much for doing all this💜💜💜"
"Thanks for existing in this fandom. I purple you, ARMY💜💜💜"
They are saving each other life. Something still  bothering Jin..Jin will be save by tae. He just have to share his thoughts to tae
Thanks for making the lives of ARMY's a little bit more easier. I purple you.💜💜💜
I'm so happy someone like you is in this fandom 😭😭😭😭 we love you so much!
"Poor seokjin, but that's his fault for lying to taehyung and the other members about being a principle's spy. But taehyung shouldn't say that they all will end up alone at the end. Ofc that's hurt seokjin because he tried to save all the members from having a bad time in their life.."
"Now, we need to know what is happening next Bighit :')  Thank you ♥"
"god watching the jungkook and yoongi guys story was like watching a sad gay story, do they realize they’re in love?"
this is amazing .. the BTS storyline is really excellent...
"Near the happy end... Bighit: Nah, I’m not gonna let it end that easily. We still have 6 more years to go. Me: die....💀💀💀💀"
Hey what if one day Celeste had a zoom with a whole bunch of us and we could all share theories we have 👀
Please create the updated version cause I m getting so excited what happened in love yourself highlight reel and later
"I love the bts story line, especially when you explain the summary and everything. You do a great job explaining and it’s such an entertaining video. 💜💜"
"Girl, I don't know how you do it, in keeping all of this straight. I am just blown away by it all. Thank you for taking the time to create this video for us. I can't imagine how long it took you to get through all of this intertwined storyline. BRAVO 👏👏👏💜"
"You know what the thing I noticed from all these... That every single thing is connected to Seokjin's father and seriously he is indeed a mystery man and maybe all things happening are planed by him only? Or maybe he already knew everything happening cuz he was a time traveler as well? Like that diary said ""Everything started from here. "" cuz all of them the 7 friends met there only. And now Jin has to save Namjoon from the fire of the container house to end all this... To end the loop but again he found that list in his father's office with Namjoon's name marked on it. So we need to find out about Seokjin's father. Cuz according to me he is the root of everything happening and he is the answer of all the questions."
oh my...thanks a lot rosan!...sometimes I forget the storyline is fiction and actually start crying haha...and this helped a lot since i dont have enough phone space to download the game
Wow all I can say is WOW .. it seems like in the end things are just meant to happen the way they do regardless cuz they’ll never be happy ... “you can’t save everybody”
The story line is harder than my Maths test but thanks to you I can understand it well now!!
Since I can't get 200 gems everytime I finish a story and because I don't wanna spend money on a game I'm gonna watch this...
24:13 wait a damn minute. i never noticed that... OMG IM SO GLAD I WATCHED THIS VIDEO
I'm crying cuz of this smartnest my ass will never be this smart ಥ_ಥ
you're so smart. you figure out theories faster than jaeguchi uploads.
I've been waiting for this for so long
Can anyone please tell in what order I should watch the MVs and read the books and webtoons? I want to understand everything and use my brain also...
Thank you 💜 it's helpful and just perfect. Thing like this that Army do to help another Army to understand BTS Univers story & music better make this fandom interaction more engaging to me. BTS Army is another level 😀👍
What about the interaction with the cat? I heard Jin and Jk had one.
I just Think BigHit was planning about all this even before the birth of members... TXT and Enhypen has some connections with this I'm not sure about Enhypen but the Cat in TXT while Given and Taken whole song specially NiKi's part was exactly like one of the scenes in BTS MV when NiKi was in Forest lying in white and black
"Tbh, I'm so glad that we have u in our fandom.. Thank you so much for helping us and making us understand about this💜"
I honestly could listen to you explaining this story for hours on end. The way you present all the information including the fitting videos in comination with your calming voice (that is perfect for story telling might I add) just creates an ideal environment. I can't wait for the update video if I'm being honest. Thank you💜
Make sure you guys also get GOOGLE TRANSLATE APP and buy Learn! KOREAN with BTS to bring you to the Beginner levels of learning Korean💜
i'm learning korean and i don't know where to learn but thanks for you ang Lingodeer you guys made my life easier😊😊
Thank you so much ...i am so glad to have you...it is because of people like you in the fandom all of us can get to know the universe better...you are a true army...your dedication to bts the mvs the epilogues prolouges and the notes and how you decipher them by each and every single happenings is really worth it...the so many timelines and events still get me confused but i am trying to cope up....i am reading the notes and at the same time..demian...pls can you suggest where in pdf can i get the notes 2 book??
"I was asleep when this came!!!! I did  tell you this earlier on twitter. Yes, BU ended on an open note. TvT no clarifications other than your theories so thankyou so much for all the effort you put in for this <3333333333333333333333333 Hope you and your family are staying safe. Borahae <33333333333333333333"
"Woau❤️ you are amazing. I cant imagine how fandom gonna be without you.its crazy.. im soo thankful to u and mad respect ❤️ you are a genius.  i have a dumb question. Im not a deluli shipper or something. Is there any mention in anywhere in the BU about yoongis and jungkooks relationship as platonic or something. I mean in the story line they are connected. So the person yoongi miss is mostly jungkook. That one scene from i need you where yoongi is lying down on side of a bed and look at the other half of the bed like he is missing someone who used to be there. I mean that kind of scenes represents usually someone who they are romanticaly attached. when i was a baby army, when i didnt even know about exsistence of BU, i thought yoongi must be missing the person he loves after seeing that scene. Now i know how complex all.these things, im still salty about that scene. Can you please explain it to my dumb brain.  Btw, i hope you arr having a great day/year. u nice.. keep going..😊❤️ love ya"
You’re just amazing. Thank you for all that you give to ARMY and to promote BTS.   💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I am still so confused lol. Because I just saw that 10 minute clip of bighit and then the comments were so confusing. And everyone led me to this. anybody else?
im crying thank u so much for this i really really appreciate ur effort 😭
The blood sweat tears Japanese mv keeps flashing to me towards the end.. Wow
Wow. This is just....wow. thank you for putting so much time and effort into this...I cant even begin to explain. So is this like a part 2 to the previous bts universe video? In a way?
The Fact that BigHit film how Hobi stop V that day.. but never release that and just give us the scene that Hobi in V's home that day.. mean BigHit probably will gave us another video from BU... BU didn't stop in this game..
Thank you so much for this 😭😭
"It is frusturating though and Seokjin frusturates me the most. He can't do this all by himself and the more he keeps this stuff to himself the more it will hurt the others and make things harder for himself.   I know this especially from reading the notes book two...   If it was me, I would have said it as soon as they asked.   Telling Tae that he is dreaming of different time lines because of the choices Seokjin makes is better than getting into a fight.   Hopefully, we can get more answers."
"When jin will enlisted in military, how the BU story line will transfrom"
Ye I'm crying again T^T
"Thank you for the summary! I still can't play the game fully (phone limits, time limits), so I really appreciate this video!  It feels like it's really similar to the events that unfold in The Note 2, except it ends at the house near the beach where taehyung and Jin got into a fight.   Waaah so interesting! I love this story world building universe! Thank you for making videos on them!!!"
thank u for helping me understand bangtan universe better. hearteu
Thank you so much for this summary!!! Im the farthest thing from being a gamer and would never known about any of  these without your help. You the man for those of us who do not play to still experience this part of the BU
THANK YOU !!!!!!!! IM FREAKIN  THANKFULLLLL!!!!!!!!!!💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"You are our QUEEN ARMY!!!! Thank you so much for making this video💜💜💜 now I'm going to send this video to all my army friends Can seokjin even tell the truth like is he allowed what if he's not supposed to say the truth!! Why did tae just remove all his frustrations on seokjin... Really after all the pain seokjin had to go through again and again he didn't expect this from his friends he saved them all even if it's not directly but still he did he was the one who could time travel.. He was THE CHOSEN ONE And even if would tell the truth would the others believe him because it's so unbelievable but my doubt is how is tae even able to see those dreams like what's the connection.. And even though tae could see those dreams he didn't do anything to save them?! Then what the point of him seeing the dreams?? Like if I were seokjin I would be really pissed off by tae😣🥴 because literally at every step all the good things that happened to each member it was because of Jin...and also when tae asked Jin earlier about his dreams Jin was scared to tell him because it could cause changes in the timeline... Also there would be absolutely no use of telling anything to tae or the members before hand as it's seokjin who has the control of time, and only he can come back to save them who cares if it's indirectly at least they survived thanks to Jin😭😭"
Thank you so much for this!!!😭😭😭 You're just THE BEST!😍
You are the best at these storylines and theories! So grateful for you !!!!  💜😭
Nice! I just learned about the theories after watching Run today. Thanks for this! Made it easier for us baby armies to understand the links between the MVs
Bless your heart for creating this.  You are seriously a SAINT! Borahae!
Also THANK YOU BECAUSE I DIDNT FINISH THE GAME BC OF MY GEMS TㅁT could you do a theory of TxT possibly being connected to BTS? I’ve noticed a lot of things connected for example one the biggest connections is the Cat we see it in the game trailer and in Nap Of A Star Jin also hears a voice in the Webtoon and V has a cat or dog that’s white could this animal be a spirt guide for Jin I think that The spirt\Cat failed with Yeonjun since we see him dead in Eternally and is  trying to help Jin because they failed the first time what do you think? This might be wrong so idk lol 😂
Thank you so much for this video omg as a baby army I'm so thankful you exist 💜💜💜💜
this deserves million views!!! Thank you so much!!!!
"The videoditing and narrating here is soo good , its always good thats y i like to hear it 😍😍...thank you for making such videos and all BTS related stuff 😭😭💜.... You are the best 💜"
i hoPe BU will be finished this year. it frustrates me.. like a k-drama that i cannot finish.. 😩 and to think i can watch a full 16 ep in a day.. 😩
I'm curious- is having a storyline like this a common kpop thing? I'm so fascinated by the story... It's such an emotional rollercoaster!
I'm a new army and I don't really know this storyline I cried love it :)
OMG I don't know what I would do without you!!!!! Thank you soooo much for putting all this together. Can't wait  for the upcoming summary video..... borahaeee💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"I just love ur explained videos and mini documentaries. Starting from ur soothing voice, to the content u collect and visuals u choose, everything is in perfect harmony. Thank u soo soo much for doing this and taking the time and effort to prepare something so genious. And special thanks to BigHit for turning us into such bigbrains lol. Cant wait for the updated storyline <3"
"Yoonkook are boyfriends in this game, the hyyh era, in the BTS comic save me and in the notes. They are boyfriends everywhere in the fictional BTS world."
"Are all their song's MV related to each other , thus creating a story? I don't understand can anyone explain?"
Untuk Kali Ini Durasinya 👎 Gpp Ya!
"Aku smpe sesak d dada ky sakit aja liat yn d gituin sm yoongi, semoga yn bisa rubah sikap jd ky cuek gitu sm yoongi, trs yn semakin dket sm JM biar yoongi cemburu gitu, fighting eonnniii"
"😭😭😭 sedihnya melihat y/n dianggap pembantu oleh suaminya sendiri didEPan selingkuhannya lagi,semoga saja yoongi cepat sadar dari rasa bencinya kepada y/n,dan semoga saja yoongi mendaparkan rasa cintanya untuk y/n,semangat dan sukses selalu..."
suami macam apa ini.. gemess..😭😭 hrus kuat yn..bila perlu bkin yoongi cmburu sma yn..
"Please make the ep 5, please also make yoongi REALIZED THAT WENDY ISN'T THE ONE FOR YOU, BUT Y/N IS THE ONLY ONE FOR YOU ('CAUSE NOT ALL PARENTS CHOICE ARE BAD), please also make yoongi REALIZED THAT WENDY ONLY USED HIM UNLIKE Y/N WHO TRULY LOVE HIM, & please also make yoongi & y/n happy together forever without any fuckin' drama"
Mungkin y/n udah mulai bersifat dingin sama Yoongi ya nggak tau lah hanya kakak / author yang tau btw semangat kak buat vidionya cepet up ya kak 😁😁😄😊😊💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩

ITZY Music Video PREMIERE For “Trust Me (MIDZY)” https://youtu.be/zi-2uJr9Jyo
goddd they are insaneee THEY KILLED THIS!!
Popular Opinion: ITZY is getting better and better in every performances
7 minutes... they danced for 7 minutes- AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAD NEW CHOREO AND BASICALLY ALREADY HAD MUSCLE MEMORY WITHOUT FORGETTING THEIR DANCE AND DANCED FOR 7 MINUTES!?!?!?!
"For new midzy: - Lia: high ponytail  - Ryujin: white hoodie - Yeji: blond, wavy hair - Chaeryeong: low ponytail - Yuna: dark, wavy hair"
why is no one talking about how chaeryeong ate this up
yuna's performance never fails to amaze me fr
bruh yuna can easily be main dancer in any groups
There’s no way Yeji is real...look at how beautiful and talented she is
"For all those bashing ITZY for BTS In the title of the video, please be educated that BTS also stands for behind the scenes. It is not referring to a boy group"
they’re taking over kpop in the future.
"nah, i'm gonna pass out omfg"
i swear im not biased but Itzy are undoubtedly one of the best performers in Kpop that nobody really talks about and we should talk more about it
Congrats JYPE for being the only entertainment company to have ITZY
Itzy is the only group that I can't even choose who my bias is
Yeji looks so stunning.
The direction of this performance was amazing✨very cool✨🕺
So no one talk about Yeji’s dance break
Lets talk about Lia. WHYS A SIMPLE PONYTAIL LOOK SO CUTE ON HER THE FIT SHE SAID HOURGLASS AND HER DANCING HERE SHARP AF😫
ITZY REALLY SAID ✨BODY GOALS✨💅
"The only thing that’ll apply accurately to just ITZY: five main vocalists,five main dancers and five rappers."
Queenssss
i stan chaeryeong EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
"Yeji in the thumbnail can honestly rail meee 😭😭😭 step on me, queen"
Yuna and Yeji are killing me with their looks😢 They're literally not even trying to be hot. My bias and bias wrecker are.... Making me shy👉👈
Seventeen: SEVENTEEN RIGHT HERE Everglow: EVERGLOOW NCT: NCITY IN THE HOOOUSE BTS:  BTS BLACKPINK: BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA Stray Kids:  STRAY KIDS AH ITZY: ITZAAAAAAAAAAAAAY Han’s intro:AHHHH 2020 WE’RE GONNA GET ‘EM STRAY KIDS IN THE BUILDING WE GONNA GO ALL IN JUST DO WHATEVER WE WANT HOLLA AT Y’ALL AY LET’S GO
Wow! Amazing...
"After this, I seriously need a SKZ Dance Racha and Yeji, Chaeryoung and Ryujin collab!"
Chaeryoung ranked 48 in 2020 Tc Candler Congratulations queen✨❤️
One of the few Kpop girl groups that every member can be the main dancer.
ITZY KILLED THIS PREFORMANCE
They’re choreography is so good. But I’m also loving their outfits: Yeji - girl boss Ryujin - cool kid Lia - cheerleader Chaeryoung - college freshman Yuna - spy/assassin
The dancing machine group of kpop
The fact that they danced for a whole 7 mins and look unphased
see what happens when Itzy does a 7-minute long performance? you finally get why they're one of the best performers of our generation.
Their all pretty and beautiful but Yuna hits diff. With that curled hairrr.
BTS: BTS BP: BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA SKZ: STRAY KIDS AH ITZY: ITZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
U all have to agreee that Itzy's dance line is not joke man!!!
BLINK here! ITZY slayed this! I think they might be one of my faves. I just recently started following them. They are up their for sure. Definitely the leaders of 4th generation. These girls are gonna be massive in a few years time.
: so who’s the main dancer? Itzy: YES
ITZY BEST FEMALE GROUP
Let's give big applause to Lia. She was hated for not being able to dance but in fact she memorized all of Itzy's complicated dance moves well.
"Ryujin aka 4th gen center, honestly no wonder she is the center, i can't take my eyes off her, her dancing is everything"
"I'm sorry, but I can't think of anything after Yeji's dance break. Seriously, her performance is perfect."
so no one is going to talk about chaeryoung? LIKE GIRL SHES ON FIRE
Yuna's charisma is overflowing!
itzy getting love on mtv page?  this midzy is happy  <3
"ITZY! Now that GOT7 left JYPE, these ladies and SKZ were the only reasons why I should stay as a JYPNation stan."
Chaeryeong being the best main dancer ever! JYP should give her more dance breaks
Yeji is the most beautiful woman walking this earth... Fact
JYP doesn't treat Chaeryeong like a Main dancer😖😞
"ITZY doesn't realize this, but they is making everyone's quarantine better."
"damn look at how much Lia has improved, im so proud of her"
"they're so comfortable to wear only like that,  doesnt need any prop"
ITZY DANCE QUEENS ITZY QUEENS ITZY QUEENS OF DANCING!!!!!!!! ITZY IS THE BEST
Lia being part to volleyball team with nayeon and Jennie🤧
This is why J.Y.P has the best group.
I like rujin outfit n her hair so cool
Why is there no comeback with Chaeryong as Lead.   Dalla Dalla - Yeji Icy - Yuna Wannabe - Ryujin  Not Shy - Lia
My girl RYUJIN hot af! 🔥
SO COOL~!! HEY! ITZY~~❤
bruh their walks at the beginning of wannabe performance is like they're famous models
LET'S BE HONEST CHAERYEONG SLAYED IT SO DID THE OTHERS
THIS IS THE BEST GIRL GROUP PERFORMANCE THAT I'VE SEEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE🔥
"Their showmanship is on another level. At their best, as always."
unpopular opinion:  itzy have the strongest dance line in the 4th gen of kpop.
"This was not a ""Behind the Scenes"" , this was a whole performance!!"
Man my bias just seems to be changing every second
ITZY never failed to show amazing and great performance!!
Ryujin's body is out of this world :o
The dance that yeji and chaeryeong danced to stays iconic
They are so pretty and great
"imo, ITZY is the group that gives that ""Girl's Energy"" vibe the most"
I swear this group is gonna rise big 🤩☝️
they're the best performers in girl group for me
ITZY's songs and choreographies are on another level
Everyone can tell the shoulder dance is not just iconic it's a legend thing.
"The infinite choreography. How to remember the step? No, how they didn't mix up the step."
ITZY ate and left no crumbs!
So no one talk about Chaeryong Abs? She's damn hot😳
The only group with no inequalities in their outfits. The stylist are doing a great job. Even the simplest can look this great 🔥
Chaeryoung looks so pure 😳
Happy 2nd anniversary ITZY!
LIAAAA GODDAMN THAT WAS POWERFUL PERFORMANCE
Tbh... I am crying while watching this and I dont know whyy😭😭
"Itzy a group of dancer trained to become singer but there is on exception, Lia. She is a vocalist trained to dance. Imagine how hard it is to be the only one of that in a group to be the only not born a dancer in a dance heavy group. We know how hard you must work Lia, to do all those super hard choreography of itzy and I have never once noticed her being “the bad dancer” of the group, not even once. Midzy know your hard work Lia and we appreciate and love you. 😽 stay strong, and keep carrying the cancer community in kpop."
Cant take my eyes from ryujin 😭💕
this is so epiiiiic
Goddamn this choreo hits HARD.
"I could like this a million times, and it still wouldn't be enough."
THE DANCE BREAK IS JUST SO PERFECT AND SATISFYING TO WATCH
"It's really unbelievable how they are so beautiful, it's like they are from another world, they are so gorgeous"
"Me : I will  see performance while reading comments  Itzy : no ,not Today ."
"this group is killing me wtf Ryujin's unfathomable swag Lia's undeniable charm Yuna's stage presence Yeji""s versatility Chaeryoung's precise and catchy dance moves they're making me insane, focc"
"When ryujin in the center, I know there's gonna something happens"
Can we appreciate Chaeryeong? Like she slays EVERY. SINGLE. PERFORMANCE.
MTV knows all the reasons what we want as a TRUE FANS of itzy.  Agreed
The choreographers  DID AMAZING ON THIS ONE!!
"Why are they so cool ??? I'm so amazed by Ryujin, he never disappoints any appearance"
chaeryeong looks so cool here

He is really humble and talented... His hyungs have influenced him really well..took great care like their own brother... It's not easy to cope up with ...when there are not one but 6 brothers around you..he is really a good younger brother..he never makes them upset at all..BTS are really good humans..
When JK says  yours is mine and mine is mine Everything is mine
3:23 their transition from offstage to onstage is making me weak

At 2:46 Jin looking like a very proud hyung 😂
"Jungkook’s tattoo sleeve visible during Run BTS cookery segment and the ARMY is not coping  Showbiz news in January has been pretty weird, and we’re crossing another unexpected item off our 2021 bingo card – getting a close look at Jungkook’s tattoos during a ham-themed episode of Run BTS. The BTS ARMY is freaking out after being given one of their clearest peeks yet at Jungkook’s sleeve, which is usually covered up or censored in videos and performances. It all happened as Jungkook rolled up his sleeves for the latest episode of Run BTS on VLive, where the band – minus Suga, who is still recovering from shoulder surgery – attempted to make the best recipe possible from canned ham, to promote the Korean pork industry. With Korean celebrity chef Baek Jongwon judging, Jungkook, RM and J-Hope attempted to make a ham and potato stew, while Jimin, V and Jin whipped up ham, ramen and rice, in the hopes of winning special knives from Mr Baek.   https://shrinke.me/AIQj0XK"
"He is supposed to have long hair, isn't he? He looks sassy with it!💜💜💜"

Huh? I thought what's yours is mine and what's mine is mine is still the motto for Jungkook and his Hyungs
Taehyung’s deep laugh.  🙋🏻‍♀️🔫🔫🔫

"Wow, as a Belgian ARMY all I can say is that this is just terrible. Jimin has more talent in his little pinky than all of you guys combined... no offense ..."
My last braincells trying to fill in an exam
I'm not even a BTS stan yet feel the shame overwashing me.
Ok but the guy in the yellow carried that whole squad
I think that the guy in yellow was the only one who was really trying
⬇️ use this as unsee button
My bts order from den Aldi has finally arrived
as being part of the belgium community I apologize in everyone's name
“Belgium is not as bad as it seems” Belgium:
Waarom zou je een gele pruik aan doen als je een zwarte/bruin  baard  hebt    Edit: dank u voor all de likes 😚
thanks for trying your best i guess......
“this beat ching-chang like money” 😐😐
only the guy in yellow is fine but i still wish to unsee this what even
I think that the guy in yellow was the only one who was really trying
How did you guys ever think this was a good idea.
''if the teachers goes out for a cup of coffee'' the class:..
And this is why I want to move to the other side of the globe.
"The one in yellow I guess? The darker skinned person, he doesn’t sound bad. 😅"
De ENIGE die dit serieus nam was die in de gele outfit

I'm crying- tf is this???😭😭💀✋🏼 lowkey feel embarrassed to live in Belgium whxhjsjsxjx🤺
"ocharme BTS ik voel me beledigd die pruiken mochten er niet zijn, echt niet. jullie hebben julliezelf echt voor schut gezet. De enige dat nog oké zijn zijn de gele en de paarse...Smh... Dit gaat er over"

"Hoodie , nachtwacht , Ketnet, helden , like me ,Karrewiet (Bedankt voor al de likes )"
"For all internationals watching this, i deeply apologise for this cringe video, i am belgian but this is just a ""no, just NO"" from me."
"Wnr ze zeggen da belgië nog ni zo erg is , hebj dit :"
It makes me appreciate BTS even more. These guys show how hard it is...
Mom: Go play with the neighbours kids  The neighbours kids:
"Army! They didn't try to make fun of bts or smth, these people must've worked hard on this performance. Let's just stop spreading negativitie! We won't gain anything doing this.   Hope you guys understand and I purple you !💜"
Oh hell nah ...  And what is up with the wigs? At least dont buy so cheap ones 👀
00:45  backflipje

i don't think they'll pass taehyung's vibe check...
"I just got this send to me by my mom and I- ... I don't know how to face her now. I mean I'm not gonna lie, the guy in yellow seemed enthusiastic, but for the rest idk... For all my fellow Belgium ARMY, I feel your pain. Fighting!!!"
I- anyways um.....😃❓
Jimin: it broken my ear
Me: can we get bts please? Mom: no. We have them at home.  The BTS at home:
Me: at first 'not bad' Also me: When they start singing 'hancur'  :)
Yass now we just need the lightstick and the photocards🥵
They have a huge difference in voice
"I love you, yellow guy! You're my bias from now on!!"
Jimin BE LIKE TIME TO SHOW OFF

In my language Jin means Ghost lol😂. Do you know the surprise about BTS ?  See here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jWt9enBznI&list=PLUwFr7dGodBgGpiTBexVPNvsU_-VS1AxK
the guy couldn’t even get jimin’s lyrics right? it’s ‘so watch me bring the fire’ not ‘so let me bring the fire’
Geweldig dit 😂
The yellow guy sings sooo gooooood
Wait till BigHit found out about this and they're so gone.
Vind het wel leuk om te zien hoe die ene in het geel echt ervan geniet haha
Belgian Army: 🤩🤩🤩🤩

"Thank you very much 👍👍👍👍  It's hard to sing while dancing, but thank you for your effort. It was nice to listen to.  춤을 추면서 노래하는게 어려운데도 노력해주셔서 감사합니다 듣기 좋았어요 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉"
벨기에까지도 퍼져간 bts
"Hahahaha I can't this is hilarious omg zo kun je n iet zijn, mijn ganse dag is gemaakt"

I love how she's just fan girling over every bangtan song HAHAAHHA
Her cats watching her: *in Morgan freeman voice* drop it likes it’s hot dats a waap
Finally we get to see the cuteness overloaded video yes.
I have never clicked so fast in my life 🤣
“I LOVE DOPE” okay...😂
When is more R6S Coming out I really like the series so far
Fire
“I LOOOOVEEE DOPE!!!” -Butters 2021
In convinced butters is a fully fledged samurai at this point.
8:25 me in the rave after I took some molly and adderall
2 uploads in 1 day WORLD RECORD😂
I was pleasantly surprised with how good the bts pack was mapped
"You know what I love about this video? The thumbnail, the songs, the way you pronounce the words, everything was spot on!"
Whoa wtf you can record like that..? Within the virtual reality yourself?? That’s neat asf
I love where it just cuts to butters like “yep I figured” and she’s just sitting on the floor 😂 Also I’m proud of you butters for pushing through! You’re doing great girl
"""My LEGSSS pleassseee please have mercy on my LEGSSS"" ~ Butters 2021"
I love watching these beatsaber vids knowing I can’t afford an oculus but still see butters enjoying it.
In love with this wholesome feeling in my chest 😭💕
Me the entire time: do every single song on the pack in one video
"It would be cool, when you play the Linkin park music pack 😁"
yall notice how good she is at it lol
"I love it when she sits on the floor and lets the song play, i do that all the time when i’m bored"
I forgot to say congratulations on 1 mil!!!
Hannah I’m trying to fix my sleep schedule but with you posting at 3 in the morning it’s kinda hard
And now I have to update my running playlist.
"I’m already happy, your vibe is so nice"
You really deserve more! Hope fully you have a successful life and youtube future.
OMG HOW R U THIS GOOD ON BEATSABER!? I now want this for my birthday so I can get better😀
Damb 2 Butters video in 1 day. I love it. Sooo much positivity and happiness in one day YAAAAAYYYY
When you were making your avatar dance it looked like how the “skids” dance in Letterkenny
"Butters: ""Y'all""  Me: She's from my neck of the woods"
You inspired me to get a quest 2 and it is so fun and a bang for your bucks. Also Beat Saber is so fun
"2 uploads, now thats an ultimate poggers moment."
I'm tryna sleep but butters posted :')
What did we do to deserve TWO videos?!?! Let's goooooo
"Now we need to see your reaction to OST4! or maybe, when you break the chains of sponsorship... custom songs 😈"
"YouTube is taking me to odd places today, but this one is a winner I think."
I have so much butterflies when watching her videos istg.
Thank u I’m getting an oculus quest 2 soon and omg I can’t thank you enough for all the Laughs throughout your videos
Bruuhhhh I love the beat saver  I hope you keep doing more videos of it  good video   like always 😂
Never clicked so fast love ya butters with positivity and happiness as always
Two videos in two days! It’s a dream come true!
I liked the warm lighting at the end uwu
2 uploads in one day there u go girl. Amazing content by the way and keep it up

She uploaded 2 videos in 24 hours congrats Butters
I really enjoy your beat saber content on tiktok it’s great 👍
My grandfather is in the hospital with the virus this really brightened up my evening
"""I LOVE DOPE!"" - Hannah/Butters, 2021  Lmao sorry, I had to. 💙"
I’m confused on how that butters is sooooo good at beat saber
What can’t this legend do👌🏽❕
The fact that you like K-Pop makes me happy! Absolutely loved this video!
Butters playing so much beat saber she gonna turn into a samari soon😂
"1mil subs ? I still remember the 100k celebration video.. Wow girl you're doing good, very nice and fun video again xD"
THE VIDEO IVE BEEM WAITING FOR
Your intro always makes my day.
i shouldn't t be awake but i am and i forgive myself for staying up now that you've uploaded ( ITS 3:00AM IN THE UK:(   )
Oh what I saw this on my front page and thought it was from a year or two ago I didn’t know it came out today
"ive been trying to get my sister to watch your vids, and when i tell her that you like bts shes DEFINITELY going to start watching you lol"
I’ve never wanted to play this but now watching this I’m contemplating it
Not sure if you'll do this on beat saber but for the next song pack can you do the Linkin Park pack on Expert + hannah? Id love to see that happen on your channel (just a suggestion you don't have to do it if you don't want to)
Love how your trying new video ideas out 💯🔥
"hey butters, i love your channel you make my days so much better i always watch your videos and you are soooooo positive thank you your such an inspiration. ❤"
its funny seeing you jam and slice blocks at the same time
I really love the beat sabre videos!! Keep em coming Butters
she seems so pure.... hearted.. also came from a loving family and was never corrupted by society.... lol soo sweet.. soo sweet!
Yay butters posted 2 vids in 2 days!!! Love you content keep it up
"Wrangler Jeans 👖 need to sponsor her, NOW!"
Hope you’re gonna make more beat saber tiktoks again
"Butters, in the next beat video you should know you should try Aurora songs, it will be very cool 💙"
You really make my day with all the positivity vibes thank u never give up
You make my days so much better🍍🍍
Omg! 2 videos in the same 24 hrs! It’s the world ending!
Let’s see how much weight I lose just playing this every day

Se copiaron de bts
Makes me real happy to see that you guys are enjoying this so much with us! Much love FAM forever 🤓💜
Taehyung prepared his whole life for this moment
JK golden maknae for a reason 🤟😎
*Tae had stayed up all night for this*
I remember V saying that he didn’t sleep all night because he was so excited/nervous for this performance 😂🤭
Tae living his dream life is it for me.
"rapper jungkook needs a comeback bruh, he be murdering it 😭. y'all should react to the song ""jump"" and the live stage as well. you'll literally go CRAZY. love y'all 💜!"
Jungkook always do the Namjoons part. True fan boy of Namjoon
Jungkook MURDERED that OMG
It's incredible how taehyung changes his voice anytime and however he wants
Did anyone notice that Taehyung's voice was soo deep and sexy when he rapped like I forgot I was still breathing
I hope that rapper JUNGKOOK   make a comeback I miss this and V gosh my holy water bighit make him rap more soooo GOOOOD DDAENG
At this point V really needs to be in at least one song with rap line. He will work so hard for it.
"jungkook killed this !! he isn’t the sub rapper for nothing, he’s an all rounder indeed"
Taehyung literally proving his title as the idol of idols. He never disappoints.
Jk rapper needs a comeback calling bighit
We need to see Jungkook rapping more.. this just made me miss him rapping in the older songs! But I love them all and they ALL KILLED it!
"Taehyung's fanboy success story 😂😂😂 and of course, JK would rap RM's part! Another fanboy success story! 😂😂😂"
i want rapper jk to make another comeback soooo bad and i cant believe yoongi let taehyung do his verse 💀💀 i bet he definitely begged for that  if i don’t see taehyung on cypher 5 it’s on sight
Of course Tae would have to rap he’s fellow Daegu brother’s part!! I love this so much!
taehyung is ready he is gonna be rapping in his own songs in the future watch him
Kookie just makes it sound so sexy 😁 wow sexy rapper
I was so surprised with Tae rapping! HE NAILED IT AAAAAAAAH
we all need more of vocal line rapping and rap line singing don’t we
Rapper jungkook needs a comeback Y'all
"If there's one person who loves Ddaeng so much as much as the rapline, that would be V. He's always hyped even on the rehearsal. 😁 And you can tell he enjoys this performance so much. 💜"
I think the hardest part for V here was to keep his shoes on.
V KILLLLLTTTTT  Suga verse; GOLDEN MAKNAE....JK......BLESSED TO HOLD THE 🎤🎤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💀💀💀💀🔥🔥🔥🔥
The fact that Taehyung was so happy makes me want to hug him gosh his so cute and jungkook...my man...my guy...the golden maknae...WHY IS HE SO GOOD IN EVERYTHING?!?!?!?!
"I really do believe kim taehyung can rap if he wanted, he has the potential & he did amazing here too!! praying for V x Rapline subunit one day 💜"
Rapper Jungkook lets goooooo
V is the one who loves this song he waits every time he had a chance to rap
Jungkook nailed it bruh💜
pls reaction *BTS JUMP 5TH MUSTER IN JAPAN LIVE*
"I remember I absolutely lost it when I first saw this. Vocal-line killed it man, straight-up heat! 🔥🔥🔥"
I love how Namjoon is coaching and rapping with Jungkook  <3  They all did awesome.
"I’m late but I gotta say this, jk really proved that he is the golden maknae"
On their mixtape tae and kookie gotta at least bless us with 1 rap track
yayyyy I was hoping you’d watch this
"ㄸ- ssang digeut makes the sound tt/d ㅐ-is a vowel that makes the sound ae ㅇ-ieung can either be a placeholder which is usually silent or it can make the sound ng  땡-ddaeng  If you guys need more help understanding the Korean aspect of the lyrics, I’d be more than happy to help.."
Jungkook is the main vocal but he’s also a sub rapper from the beginning.
When Jungkook's rap is clearer than the blue sky😍
"I was supposed  to recommend this when i watch the rapline reaction to this earlier  but im in a hurry ao didn't Glad you do it, JK and V killin it i see jiminie suppressing he's laughing when JIN  do it but salute to the vocals lines love it"
"Love it when the rap line ""guide"" the vocal line to do the rap. Like when J-Hope was there with Jimin and Jin, Suga with V, and RM with JK. So proud of vocal line to do the rap line song."
5:22 It's Hobi singing it like that fam. 😌 Love this performance because it's so fun watching the vocal line rapping and also because of how Hobi kinda like created a different version ❤
"JK truly is a golden boy ,he can do everything!!  HIS HYUNGS ARE VERY PROUD OF HIM AS WELL US ARMY!!!  I LOVE THEM SO MUCH!!!"
Yay!! I just woke up and saw this notification 😂😂  Vocal line did an amazing job and i really wish they would rap more if not anyone else then atleast V (taehyung) should... He is always excited for raps..🥺💜
the way jimin started it off so softly is soooo funny and adorable
"I'd actually really like a song with Tae rapping, he'd kill it!"
"Lol... you guys are funny 😄 this is one of my favorite performances specially JK, part with Namjoon, he kills it . I’m so glad you guys got to see it and share with us"
"Loved this, loved the vocal line slaying the song. Jungkook is just outstanding, smooth as silk. That was RM's part & just look how proud he is. They just enjoyed this performance too. Thank you."
"In this rap Daeng the version of RM is what I love, I love his style in this Daeng. And when Jk rap this I couldn't believe it 😍"
"That whole performance was fire, dope and dang"
I HAVE WAITED FOR THIS MOMENT!!
I was bias wrecked by my own bias when I first saw this performance. V killed it! Vocal line has potential to be a part of the rap line and I’m all here for it!    Edit: please react to the vocal line’s Coca Cola commercial.. they did a cover of X Ambassadors’ Jungle! JK really fits that style! 🙌🏼
I love Blaze & Niko...so much fun to watch... Ok...I adore ALL 7 talented & amazing members...but DAENG...JK can do it all well.
I was just re-watching your save me reaction 😂 and I came running here because of the notification 🙊😂 love your videos guys 💜
jungkook being a fanboy of rm and taehyung being a fanboy of suga is just peak them behaviour
"Okay I didn't realise Tae's voice goes that deep when he starts to rap like, damn son, that's a talent right there-"
Thank god it’s out💜 I was dying out of excitement for this one I even set an alarm for it💜💜  It’s 6:30 am here in india and i never wake up this early
RAPPER JUNGKOOK IS ON A WHOLE ANOTHER LEVEL
"Boys please react to ""Tony Montana"" You will love it. Suga is ""The King of Swag"" indeed."
V is the biggest fan of rapline..that's the fact😂
"*The Rap Line:* So we'll let you guys sing our parts in Ddaeng, but there's only three, so two of you will have to share-  *Jungkook and V, already shoving Jin and Jimin out of the way:* We've trained our whole lives for this moment"
Just imagine how much money suga would have taken from V to let him song his verse.😃
Did anyone notice how Jungkook changed the lyrics to ' I'm JK '??? He is freaking cool bruh
"Make Tae’s dreams come true, manifest Cypher V"
Finally Tae gets to show what he is really passionate about with the world without the rapline stopping him! Haha 😂
"Jungkook: ""I'm JK You're Ddaeng""  😂😂"
Tae getting to do yoongis part is so special.  Tae has said yoongi is his favorite rapper and he has always wanted to do yoongis part.  we all know how jk looks up to namjoon. but lets not forget its the same for tae with yoongi
i'm excited for the BEHIND THE SCENES!!!!! 💜💜💜💜
So we know Tae is the biggest AgustD fan and JK is the biggest RM fan. I died bye
"V is dangerous, omg he's good at everything"
"Some reactors thought Tae was gonna cover Namjoon’s part but Taehyung being the rapper Suga enthusiast that he is of course covered Suga’s part and did an amazing job doing so 😏😂 the way he spit the lines and the way his voice changes with the verse, damn 👑🔥 Tae’s been waiting for this moment his entire life 😂"
V é incrível💯 sua voz e maravilhosa amo demais kim taehyung 💜💚🇧🇷
finally you guys react to this. I've been waiting for a long time. Look ... the vocal line is rocking the world of army.
Let's all call the BTS Rapline and ask them have raper JK come back ✊🏼💜
I love this Ddaeng OT7 version! they all slayed it! and I love how the rapline hyped the vocal line! Jimin and Jin did a great job with Hobi’s verse! 👏🏻 JK and Taehyung are huge rapline enthusiast (especially the Cyphers) ~ they really did an amazing job with Yoongi and Joon’s verse!
when V drunk the water i was like ooooh noo he is about to go off
thank you very much for reacting to the vocal line ddaeng i'm very happy kisses 🇧🇷
"They all look so natural in this performance , ddaemn !!! I just wanna scream whenever I watch this ! 🔥  Manifesting a new rap performance with vocal line !!!"
Jungkook has no right being as good at rap as he is. Like PLEASE. Spare a talent for the rest of us sir
I just  love that both Tae and JK got to rap their heroes' verse 💜🥺
"I died when jk said "" im jk your daeng""😂😂😂 yup he said it😆"
Look at 'em rap line is being proud of their vocal liners~
"Jungkook’s rapping has a musical quality to it. 😊 And his usual way of speaking is sort of rhythmic and almost lilting. I think Tae even said he sounds like he’s rapping when he talks sometimes. Talking, singing, rapping . . . I just love listening to him. His voice is really light and warm. 🥰"
Rapper Jungkook has my heart and soul 💓 The  vocal line totally killed it!
Love your intros 😍🤟🤟....... I'm glad you all loved it as much as I did 🤩🤩.....  Vocal line rapping is extreme hype 🔥🔥🔥🔥
My favorite part is how Tae got to rap Yoongi's verse because he looks up to him and JK got RM verse also his role model
i forgot breathing when taehyung started rapping because this guy was dead as changing his tones like it’s so simple while rapping! 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥 his deep voice always kills me
if V is not given a rap verse on any of their songs in the future i'll march to big hit myself
"i heard tae was supposed to be a rapper when debuted, he can do it all"
no one is talking about jin but he did so good☝🏾
When Your Vocal Line Can Rap & Your Rap Line Can Sing 💪🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I don’t see anyone saying it so imma say it. Jin killed it sounding like J-Hope out here at 2:27 😎
"Tae begore the concert when the rapline said the vocal line can sing Ddaeng: **I've waited my whole career for this! I'm ready bitch, just tell me who's part!""**"
Jin be like : okay guys let's finish this
6:41 namjoon looking for the haters at the back😂
Jungkook being good at everything 😍 the definition of perfect 🤧
"I don't know if you know this...but in the beginning, V was suppose to be part of the rap line. He wanted to be a part of the vocal line, so J-Hope switched with him to make V happy."

"Hey guys, hope you like this video and please don't take this video seriously. I'm sorry for my grammar and hope you guys stay safe❤️❤️"
To be honest..Y/n is a hardworking person except for the fact that she needs to face everything even hates...i'm so proud author-nim for this episode...it shows that Y/n is a really hardworking idol...and a student...i wish i was her🥺
"Tae: OMG it's FILAA! I'M NOT CHEATING ON GUCCI!!! ME: *worldwide Gucci guy,coming right up* 😅😂😂🤣🤣 *Btw I really like these series of y/n as 8th member of bts* 💜😊"
1). When you start getting hate and got depressed. 2). When they made you cry. 3). When you had an accident and they were in a meeting. 4). When your lover cheat on you. 5). When one of the members accidentally slapped you. 6). When all the members got a really high temperature. 7). When they had a misunderstanding and treat you badly.   Please Unnie make atleast one of these ideas...... Please🥺
I love Y/N even though she is just imaginary😂
"I am jimin today, sorry! I was dancing in bts songs. And please give me a shoutout! Unnie."
"Unnie, can you do a ''When You Prank Them''?"
"This is my first fanfiction where there  is no love relationship only just care and kidness , bro and sis relationship 😭😭😭  And i totly love it..🔥 Can i get shout out..plz..unnie"
I can totally relate to the part where y/n couldn't understand anything that is for the exam but I would have just sat there sulking instead of studying 😵😵😓😓BTW it was a masterpiece💜💜👌🏻
Imagination is too funny Y/n is a very hard working girl
Please make some more and can you do when you are drunk or when a sasaeng fan hurt you or theres wardrobe malfuntion pleaseeee
i'm again jimin a today🥲🥲🥲due to my school
"Ik I'm really late But,as usual, I LOVED IT! You never disappoint us! But can you do ""when you are drunk- you as the 8th member""? or ""when you get your wisdom teeth removed-you as the 8th member""?"
"Hi, authornim! Can you write “When you and Bts go on vacation, but u are lost while shopping.   And the ending is like this: After they find u, they bring u to an amusement park.  Tq!  (◠‿◕)"
I am jimin everyday 💜💜 😂😂 my notify is so slow like me
I am a little late          Didn't watched it yet but I know it will be a masterpiece 💜💜💜💜💜👍 keep going 👍💜
Please make when they are searching you and you are in the club with your friends
Please can we have one were y/n gets into a huge argument with the boys and then gets severely hurt by a sasaeng
Hey unnie SHOUT OUT! ALSO a request When you get attacked by a saesang fan of yours.
Hi! Authornim can u pls write one where she gets surgery and they cry and take care of her because she is really sick
"Unnie can you make:  (When they got to know that you have a boyfriend, you as the 8th member of the group)"
If you guys know all the song....I love you 😐💜
Jimin: Finally found jammiess yay!! Me: OMG becomes a really iconic line🤣🤣🤣🤣
"I really like how there is no love interest in this fanfic. In other fanfics there is one member who is having crush on y/n and that really destroys the element of friendship , if you know what I mean."
Late again not surprised 😑😑
reading the drunk text is like reading alien language  loved this btw
Thank you so much for making this topic  Fan from India
Unnie shout out pweaseee well as SUGA HYUNG SAID: WHY IS EVERYONE SO WEIRD TODAY!

Namjoon and suga were adorable while drunk ☺️
Can you make when you get your period while performing solo you as 8 member of bts  And second if you don't like first one   When You and yoongi fight because of some misunderstanding you as 8 member of bts
namjoon still carrying over with his place as the leader when drunk...why am i not surprised???
"Request idea ""when u act cuteeeee to gain their attention 😉"""
""" i wish we cud put the book on our head and all the things we need to know get absorbed by our brain""  Gosh yn and my thoughts match so much."
When you are attacked by a mob of saesangs and got injured badly and ended up having surgery.
Afterrr so longggg Finallyyyy U r osmm author nim💜
Can you do “when you have a Kdrama and your the main lead but they are jealous of the man lead “
"Unnnie.!? 🌷🥺💖 Can you do when y/n goes to the shopping mall but lots of army’s follow her so she gets lost. But when she gets lost she runs into an old friend and hangs out with them without BTS knowing, and they get very worried and they call the police to report her missing? 😂🥺🥳💖"
2 dislikes from-        *Bang-PD*     A N D   *Manager Sejin* 😂😂

"Unnie I love your videos!! ❤️❤️ can you make a video about:   1.

The day the other members started calling y/n ‘cupcake’  3. Y/n and the other members going to fan meet and interacting with fans  4. Y/n and members going on a concert tour in other countries  5. Y/n and the members doing interviews in Ellen and etc.   6. Y/n going chaotic with the maknae line and hyung line are so done with them  7. Everyone having fun in photoshoots  8. Y/n crying after the other members prank her and scaring her  9. Oppas giving and bringing y/n gifts and food before they go home to the dorms  10. When y/n became a fashion icon and has been trending ever since, and oppas support her.  Please 🥺🙏🏻"

Thank you for posting it. Not only is it the FULL performance but also very high quality:D
Why did they delete it? I NEED A EXPLANATION FROM PAPA MOCHI
Tnx...this is a part of bts history
I AM HERE BECAUSE IT IS GONE 🙁 and I thank you for this video ❤💜❤
this is my fav BTS performance I wish they would post it
"For those who didn't know, they removed the video from The Late Late show because they did not pay the copyright .. so the channel earned money for the presentation of the boys but they didn't receive any money in exchange"
The fact that black swan was first performed in the James Corden Show
"Korea has great artists. BTS has changed the way I see their industry. There are artists like them, Mamamoo and Dreamcatcher with healthy relationship with their company. Talented, fun personalities and with great producers. BTS are a league of their own. Mamamoo vocal powerhouses. Dreamcatcher a different music. They’ve awakened in me to love rock again. They’re from smaller companies so if you like music and you’d be interested to check out Odd Eye 👁 I’m just rambling cause only music has gotten me through this nonending pandemic and this is where it all started. This performance that redefined pop music. Truly one of a kind."
"Jimin is on his tippy toes a lot, either he feels short or it’s just his insane ballet dancing skills taking over....might be both."
"I don't know, the feeling yesterday I watched this on YouTube is jammes itself, but why did I come back yesterday to watch it again, huh?"
"THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!! I still cant believe they took down the video , heart been broken so many times 😭😭"
"This video was deleted, why this happens to BTS alone other artists performance are still there too😭😭😭💜. Thanks for uploading, we missed a lejindary performance."
dayummnn they deleted it again 😫
How the hell...?  How can they sing so good wheil dancing like this??????????
Finally i found this😭😭😭 why did they delete it 😢😢
